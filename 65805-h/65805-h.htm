<h2 id="c1"><span class="small"><span class="large">A FATAL MESSAGE;</span>
<br />Or, NICK CARTER&rsquo;S SLENDER CLEW.</span></h2>
<p class="center">Edited by CHICKERING CARTER.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER I.</span>
<br />A SUSPICIOUS WIRE.</h2>
<p>Nick Carter leaned nearer to the wall and listened
to what the two men were discussing.</p>
<p>The wall was that of a booth in the caf&eacute; of the
Shelby House. It was a partition of matched sheathing
only, through which ordinary conversation in the adjoining
booth could be easily overheard, and both men
in this case spoke above an ordinary tone.</p>
<p>Obviously, therefore, they were discussing nothing of
a private nature, or anything thought to be of much importance,
or serious significance. It meant no more to
them, in fact, than it would have meant to most men,
to all save one in a million.</p>
<p>That one in a million was seated alone in the next
booth&mdash;Nick Carter.</p>
<p>The two men were strangers to the detective. They
had entered when he was near the end of his lunch, and
while waiting for their orders to be served they engaged
in the conversation which, though heard only by
chance, soon seriously impressed the detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were a little later than usual this noon, Belden,&rdquo;
said one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a few minutes, Joe, but I thought you would
wait for me. My ticker got busy just as I was about
to leave. I remained to take the dispatch, Gordon, and
it proved to be quite a long one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something important?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very. Only political news for the local paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belden evidently is a telegraph operator,&rdquo; thought
Nick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything warm by wire this morning?&rdquo; questioned
Gordon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nothing,&rdquo; said Belden; and then he abruptly
added: &ldquo;There was a singular message, however, and an
unusual circumstance in connection with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so, Arthur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dispatch was addressed to John Dalton, and we
were instructed to hold it till called for,&rdquo; Belden explained.
&ldquo;I looked in the local directory, but it contained
no John Dalton. I inferred that he was a traveling
man, or a visitor in town, whose address was not
known by the sender.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange to say, however, he showed up in about five
minutes and asked if we had a dispatch for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, is there anything strange in that? He evidently
was expecting it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was strange that he came in so quickly, almost
while I was receiving the message. That, too, was singular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The message?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I remember it, Joe, it read: &lsquo;Dust flying. S. D.
on way. Ware eagle,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Belden. &ldquo;It was signed
with only a single name&mdash;&lsquo;Martin.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was then that Nick Carter pricked up his ears and
leaned nearer to the wall to hear what the two men
were saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove, that was a bit singular,&rdquo; remarked Gordon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dust flying, eh?&rdquo; Gordon laughed. &ldquo;The dispatch
must have come from a windy city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It came from Philadelphia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wrong, then. Not even dust flies in Philadelphia.
Did Dalton send an answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I know of; certainly not from our office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or volunteer any explanation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. It probably was a code message, or had some
secret significance. He took the dispatch and departed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A stranger to you, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Total stranger. I don&rsquo;t imagine the message amounted
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
to anything. It appeared a bit odd, however, and&mdash;ah,
here&rsquo;s our grub,&rdquo; Belden broke off abruptly. &ldquo;The Martini
is mine, waiter. Here&rsquo;s luck, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was obvious to Nick that the discussion of the telegram
was ended. He immediately arose and departed.
He sauntered into the hotel office, then out through the
adjoining corridor, which just then was deserted, of
which he took advantage. He quickly adjusted a simple
disguise with which he was provided, and he then passed
out of a side door leading to the street. Nick was watching
the caf&eacute; when the two men emerged. He followed
them until Gordon parted from his companion and entered
a large hardware store, where he evidently was
employed.</p>
<p>Arthur Belden walked on leisurely alone, and Nick
judged that he was heading for the main office of the
Western Union Company, whose sign projected from a
building some fifty yards away. The detective walked
more rapidly, and quickly overtook him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you, Belden?&rdquo; said he, slipping his hand
through the young man&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t appear surprised.
Pretend that you know me. I have something to say
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belden was quick-witted, and he immediately nodded
and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will explain presently,&rdquo; Nick continued. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait
until we are under cover. It&rsquo;s barely possible that we
are observed. You work in the telegraph office, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;m assistant manager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got a private office?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I receive and send most of the important dispatches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough. I&rsquo;m going with you to your office.
Carry yourself as if it was nothing unusual. Fine day
overhead, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, great,&rdquo; laughed Belden, gazing up. &ldquo;This way.
We&rsquo;ll cross here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick accompanied him across the street into the building.
Not until they were seated in his private office,
however, did the detective refer to the matter actuating
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in the adjoining booth while you and your
friend Gordon were discussing a telegram received here
this morning,&rdquo; Nick then explained. &ldquo;I wish to talk
with you about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what reason?&rdquo; questioned Belden, more sharply
regarding him. &ldquo;Have you any authority in the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so? Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick saw plainly that the young man was trustworthy.
He smiled agreeably, yet said, quite impressively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is strictly between us, Belden, so be sure that
you don&rsquo;t betray my confidence under any circumstances.
I am in Shelby on very important business. Any indiscretion
on your part might prove very costly. You read
your local newspaper and must know me by name, at
least. I am the New York detective, Nick Carter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belden&rsquo;s frank face underwent a decided change. He
quickly extended his hand, saying earnestly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By gracious, I ought to have guessed it. Know you
by name&mdash;well, I should say so! I&rsquo;m mighty glad to
meet you, too, Mr. Carter, and to be of any service.
The local paper has, indeed, had a good deal to say about
you and your mission here, as well as about your running
down Karl Glidden&rsquo;s murderer, Jim Reardon. Yes,
by Jove, I ought to have guessed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belden referred to recent events. The secret employment
of Nick and his assistants to run down the perpetrators
of a long series of crimes on the S. &amp; O. Railway,
his investigation of the murder of the night operator
in one of the block-signal towers, resulting in the detection
and death of the culprit, James Reardon, and
the arrest of several of his associates suspected of being
identified with the railway outlaws, though their
guilt could not then be proved&mdash;all had occurred during
the ten days that Nick Carter, Chick, and Patsy had
been in Shelby, and all still were vividly fresh in the
public mind.</p>
<p>Nick smiled faintly at Belden&rsquo;s enthusiastic remarks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We still have much to accomplish here,&rdquo; he replied,
referring to himself and his assistants. &ldquo;We got James
Reardon, all right, and cleaned up that signal-tower
mystery, which was what we first undertook to do. That
did not clinch our suspicions against some of his associates,
however, as I had hoped it would do. I refer
to Jake Hanlon, Link Magee, and Dick Bryan, who have
succeeded in wriggling from under the wheels of justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you expect to get them later?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect to, yes,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;But my identity and
mission in Shelby now are generally known. That has
put the railway bandits on their guard, which makes our
work more difficult. But that&rsquo;s neither here nor there,
Mr. Belden, and I am wasting time. I wish to see a
copy of that telegram you were discussing with Gordon
and to ask you a few questions about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead. Go as far as you like, Mr. Carter. I&rsquo;ll
never mention a word of it,&rdquo; Belden earnestly assured
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you,&rdquo; Nick replied. &ldquo;About what time was
the telegram received?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Dalton called for it almost immediately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Within three or four minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That indicates that he was expecting it at just that
time,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;If I am right, and I think I am, he
was acting under plans previously laid with the sender,
Martin, or he was otherwise informed just when the
message would be sent. Do you recall ever having received
another dispatch from Philadelphia signed Martin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not,&rdquo; said Belden, shaking his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What type of man is Dalton? Describe him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a well-built man, about forty years old, quite
dark, and he wears a full beard. He was clad in a plaid
business suit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The beard may have been a disguise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I would have detected it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not detect mine,&rdquo; smiled Nick. &ldquo;He may be
equally skillful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be something in that,&rdquo; Belden admitted,
laughing. &ldquo;At all events, Mr. Carter, the man was a
total stranger to me. But why do you regard the message
so suspiciously?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you a copy of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belden stepped into the outer office, returning presently
with a spindle, on which were copies of all of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
telegrams received that day. He began to remove them,
seeking the one in question, and Nick said, while waiting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, Belden, have you received any other telegrams
from Philadelphia this morning, or within a day
or two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. There was one this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see that, also. Was it received before the
other, or later?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About an hour earlier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see both of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is the first one,&rdquo; said Belden. &ldquo;It was received
at nine o&rsquo;clock. See for yourself, Mr. Carter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick took the telegram and read it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Gus Dewitt</span>, Reddy House, Shelby: Ten will hit me.
Quickest route.</p>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">A. Monaker.</span>&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was a message that would have signified very little
to most men. It might have been an ordinary business
communication, a wire concerning the price and quantity
of desired merchandise and the direction for shipping
it.</p>
<p>Nick Carter&rsquo;s strong, clean-cut face, however, took on
a more intent expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove, I am right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hundred to one
that this was sent to notify Dalton just when to call
for the message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you think so?&rdquo; Belden inquired, leaning
nearer to read the telegram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For three reasons,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;First, the signature&mdash;A.
Monaker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about it? It evidently is a man&rsquo;s name. I see
nothing remarkable in that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is, nevertheless,&rdquo; Nick replied. &ldquo;Monaker, Belden,
is a slang term for a nickname. Undoubtedly in
this case it refers to a fictitious name, or an alias. It
means, I think, that an alias would be used in the message
afterward sent, signed Martin and addressed to
John Dalton, presumably an alias of which Dalton already
was informed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By gracious, Carter, you may be right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten will hit me told Dalton at just what time he
must expect the message. He was, in effect, directed to
call for it at that hour. Obviously, too, the business
is secret and important, as well as off color, or such a
circumspect method of communication would not be necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely not,&rdquo; Belden agreed. &ldquo;But what do you make
of the last&mdash;quickest route?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By wire, Belden, of course,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;A telegram
is the quickest means of communication when the telephone
cannot be wisely and conveniently used.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, too,&rdquo; Belden readily admitted. &ldquo;By Jove,
you have a long head, Mr. Carter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Training enables one to detect such points as these,&rdquo;
Nick replied. &ldquo;Do you know Gus Dewitt, to whom this
message is addressed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was sent to the Reddy House.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It may have been signed for by the clerk, or
delivered to Dewitt himself. The boy who took it there
could tell us, but he is out just now. You can telephone
to the Reddy House and find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not by a long chalk,&rdquo; Nick quickly objected. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want my interest in this matter suspected. Have you
found the other message?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, here it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belden tendered the yellow paper on which the copied
message was written.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER II.</span>
<br />THE INTERCEPTED LETTER.</h2>
<p>Nick Carter read more carefully the telegram discussed
in the hotel caf&eacute;, and which had so seriously
aroused his suspicions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">John Dalton</span>, Shelby: Dust flying. S. D. on way.
Ware eagle.</p>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">Martin.</span>&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Belden watched the detective for a moment, then
asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make of it? Dust flying seems to have
no definite significance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, Belden, it is very significant to me,&rdquo;
said Nick. &ldquo;You have heard it said, no doubt, that some
men have dust on their clothes, others in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dust&mdash;you mean money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. There is money moving in some way, Belden,
or about to be moved, of which felonious advantage
is going to be taken. In other words, Belden, crooks
are out to get the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I see!&rdquo; Belden exclaimed, with eyes lighting.
&ldquo;You suspect that a crime is being framed up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely. I feel reasonably sure of it, in fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For any other reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Notice the last phrase in the message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ware eagle,&rdquo; said Belden, reading it. &ldquo;What the
deuce can you make of that? Is one of them to wear
an eagle, or some such insignia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A warning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely. Observe the spelling of &lsquo;ware.&rsquo; The word
does not refer to something to be worn, or it would be
properly spelled. It is an abbreviation of the word beware.
In reality, Belden, the phrase means: Beware
eagle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how do you interpret that?&rdquo; questioned Belden
perplexedly. &ldquo;Why is Dalton to beware of an eagle. I
can&rsquo;t see any sense to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick laughed a bit grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can,&rdquo; he said tersely. &ldquo;Crooks have favored me with
all sorts of names and epithets. I am the eagle referred
to, Belden, as sure as you&rsquo;re a foot high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! I see the point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man, Martin, the sender of the message, has
warned Dalton to beware of me,&rdquo; Nick added. &ldquo;It was
that phrase that first led me to suspect the character of
the entire message. It is generally known, now, that I
am here in the service of the S. &amp; O. Railway. This
message convinces me, therefore, that another of the
railway crimes is about to be attempted. It&rsquo;s up to me
to head it off, if possible, or at least to get the outlaws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove, you are a wonderful man, Mr. Carter,&rdquo; said
Belden, with much enthusiasm. &ldquo;There is no denying
that you probably have interpreted both messages correctly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; said Nick modestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can you head off the anticipated crime, or
succeed in getting the outlaws?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s another part of the story,&rdquo; Nick replied,
smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of them evidently is on the way here. Some one
whose initials are S. D.,&rdquo; added Belden, glancing at the
message. &ldquo;If you can identify him and find Gus Dewitt&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall certainly do the latter,&rdquo; Nick interposed. &ldquo;But
you are wrong in regard to the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;S. D. does not, in all probability, refer to a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To a special-delivery letter,&rdquo; said Nick confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, by thunder!&rdquo; Belden exclaimed. &ldquo;That must be
right, too. You have nailed every point in both of these
messages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the next step, Belden, is to nail the special-delivery
letter,&rdquo; Nick declared. &ldquo;It presumably is coming
from Philadelphia, and most likely sent by this man
Martin. Do you know whether a mail from Philadelphia
has arrived here since ten this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There has not,&rdquo; said Belden promptly. &ldquo;I know all
about the mails. One is due here from Philadelphia at
two o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good. Let me use your telephone to talk with
one of my assistants. I want him to meet me at the post
office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. Go as far as you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the meantime, Belden, kindly make me a copy
of each of these messages,&rdquo; Nick added, turning to the
telephone. &ldquo;I then will be off to intercept that special-delivery
letter. I may yet succeed, I think, in putting
something over on Martin, Dalton, and Dewitt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belden hastened to comply.</p>
<p>Nick called up the Shelby House, in the meantime, and
quickly got in communication with Chick Carter and
Patsy Garvan, his two assistants, both of whom he directed
to meet him in disguise at the local post office.
Then, having again cautioned Belden to absolute secrecy,
Nick hastened away to keep the appointment.</p>
<p>It was half past one when he entered the post office,
where he found Chick and Patsy awaiting him. Without
delaying to explain the situation, he at once led the way
to the private office of the postmaster, Adam Holden,
who readily gave him an interview.</p>
<p>Nick then made himself known, introducing Chick and
Patsy, after which he exhibited the two telegrams, confiding
his suspicions to Holden and stating what he required
of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is decidedly against the law, Mr. Carter,
the intercepting and opening of another person&rsquo;s letter,&rdquo;
Holden forcibly objected. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how I can consent
to let you do so. It is a very serious offense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not nearly as serious as the circumstances,&rdquo; Nick
forcibly argued. &ldquo;When dealing with offenders against
the law, with a gang of criminals engaged in we know
not what, nor have other means of learning, an unlawful
step in order to foil them and serve the law may
very properly be taken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly. I do not feel, nevertheless, that I can
permit&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Holden, you wait one moment,&rdquo; Nick interrupted.
&ldquo;It is absolutely necessary that I shall see that
letter. I will assume all of the responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or, if you prefer,&rdquo; Nick cut in impressively, &ldquo;I will
send Chick to Judge Barclay, of the local court, and
get from him a special order to open the letter. He
is corporation counsel for the S. &amp; O. Railway Company
and will have a very keen appreciation of the
circumstances. Bear in mind, too, that the letter is not
to be held up permanently. It will be delayed only a
very few minutes, and the recipient will be none the
wiser. I can open and reseal the letter without his even
suspecting it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Holden said reluctantly. &ldquo;You get an
order from the court, Mr. Carter, and I will yield to
your wishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attend to it, Chick,&rdquo; said Nick, turning to his assistant.
&ldquo;State the circumstances to Judge Barclay and
bring the order here as quickly as possible. You will
have no trouble in getting it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely not,&rdquo; Chick agreed, rising to go. &ldquo;He has
absolutely confidence in your judgment. I&rsquo;ll return within
a quarter hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have ample time,&rdquo; put in Holden. &ldquo;The mail
will not be in for nearly half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;In the meantime, Patsy,
you go to the Reddy House and see what you can learn
about Gus Dewitt. You will probably find him there,
for he must be expecting the special-delivery letter
and should be waiting for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing, chief, if the game is what you suspect,&rdquo;
Patsy declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be off, then, and phone me here,&rdquo; Nick directed.
&ldquo;Make sure you do nothing to arouse his suspicions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust me for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look up Dalton, also, and see what you can learn
about him. Call me up in half an hour for further
instructions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you, chief,&rdquo; said Patsy, hastening to depart.</p>
<p>Nick waited patiently.</p>
<p>Postmaster Holden appeared nervous and uncertain.
He was relieved in about fifteen minutes, however, by
the return of Chick, bringing from the magistrate the
order Nick had requested.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later a mail wagon rattled into the post-office
yard, and Holden went to bring all of the special-delivery
letters to his private office.</p>
<p>There proved to be only six of them, and the one referred
to in the telegram was easily determined. It bore
the Philadelphia postmark and was addressed to Gus
Dewitt, at the Reddy House.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you open and reseal it?&rdquo; Holden questioned
doubtfully, while the detective examined the letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very easily,&rdquo; said Nick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that it will not be detected?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely. A little steam will turn the trick, no wax
having been applied to the flap of the envelope. Your
radiator will serve us. We&rsquo;ll find out in about two
minutes what this letter contains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick arose while speaking and stepped to the radiator.
He turned the key of the small air tube and
opened the valve. A faint blowing and sputtering ensued,
soon followed by the ejection of a slender stream
of steam.</p>
<p>Nick adjusted it carefully, then held the back of the
envelope in the thread of steam until the heat and
moisture softened the paste on the flap, which he then
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
opened without injury, removing the letter and laying the
envelope aside to dry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Chick, we&rsquo;ll see what Martin has to say in this
special delivery,&rdquo; he remarked complacently, while unfolding
the single sheet of paper so artfully taken from
its cover.</p>
<p>Chick drew nearer to gaze at it.</p>
<p>The communication also was typewritten, on a sheet
of perfectly plain paper. It read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Dear Gus</span>: The pay-roll package goes through to-night,
Tuesday, on the Southern Limited. We&rsquo;ll have
the substitute down fine in ample time, and the other
dead to rights. Be on hand to relieve us of the goods
at the point agreed upon. Nothing doing until south
of North Dayton. It looks like a walk-over. I will see
you after turning the trick.</p>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">Martin.</span>&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nick Carter glanced through the letter, then read it
aloud to his two companions. The significance of it
could not be mistaken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By gracious!&rdquo; Holden exclaimed. &ldquo;You were right,
Mr. Carter. It&rsquo;s a job to rob the express car on the
Southern Limited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing less,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;I suspected something of
the kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That train is due here from Philadelphia soon after
midnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fit hour for such a felonious job,&rdquo; Nick declared.
&ldquo;But we must be equal to the needs of the hour. Not a
word of this to others, Holden, under any circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely not. You can depend upon my discretion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will make a copy of this letter. You then may
reseal it and have it delivered precisely as if it had not
been opened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do so, Mr. Carter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took Nick only a few moments to make the copy.
Holden had not finished resealing the letter, however,
when the ringing of the telephone was the harbinger
of a communication from Patsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold that letter until after I have a talk with him,&rdquo;
Nick directed.</p>
<p>Patsy&rsquo;s report was brief and to the point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Dalton is not known here,&rdquo; said he, speaking
from a booth in the Reddy House. &ldquo;Gus Dewitt arrived
here two days ago. He has been here on other occasions
for a day or two, but nothing definite is known
about him. He now is in the hotel office and evidently
is waiting for the special-delivery letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything more?&rdquo; Nick inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all to date,&rdquo; returned Patsy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my eye
on the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep it on him, Patsy, after he receives the letter,&rdquo;
Nick directed. &ldquo;Shadow him, if possible, or find some
way to trail him. Listen while I tell you what the
letter contains. It may be of advantage to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot! I&rsquo;m all ears,&rdquo; said Patsy.</p>
<p>Nick then repeated the letter verbatim and told Patsy
of what his suspicions consisted, again directing him to
make a special mark of Dewitt until otherwise instructed.
Replacing the receiver, Nick then turned to the postmaster
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Holden, you may send that letter along. Take
it from me, too, that Dalton will not be the wiser&mdash;until
I snap a pair of bracelets on his wrists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sooner the better, Carter, in my opinion,&rdquo; replied
the other. &ldquo;It could be done when the letter is delivered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that, Holden, but that&rsquo;s much too soon. It&rsquo;s
not going to be done until I can put bracelets on every
crook engaged in this job,&rdquo; Nick declared, with grim
determination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you that that would be still better,&rdquo;
smiled Holden, turning to hasten out with the fateful
letter&mdash;for such it proved to be.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER III.</span>
<br />NICK CARTER&rsquo;S PLANS.</h2>
<p>Starting with a fine spun thread, a mere film that only
one man in a million would have picked up under such
circumstances, Nick Carter had gradually twisted it to
the size of a cord of considerable strength, of which he
now aimed to make a rope with which to twist, perhaps,
the necks of the culprits deserving it.</p>
<p>It was after two o&rsquo;clock when Nick, still in disguise
and in company with Chick, left the Shelby post office.</p>
<p>Three o&rsquo;clock found them seated with Judge Barclay
and President Burdick, of the S. &amp; O. Railway, in
the magnate&rsquo;s private office, to both of whom Nick had
stated his discoveries and suspicions.</p>
<p>It was then that he picked up another strand for the rope.</p>
<p>He learned from President Burdick that an express
shipment of sixty thousand dollars in currency and specie
was to be made from Philadelphia that day, for the payroll
and construction expense on the Shelbyville branch
road, then being built; which had aroused the bitter and
vengeful opposition of a lawless section of the country
through which it was to pass, resulting in the numerous
crimes and outrages to which the road since had been
subjected, and the perpetrators of which Nick and his
assistants had been employed to run down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This proves to be about what I suspected,&rdquo; Nick remarked,
after hearing Burdick&rsquo;s statements. &ldquo;We are up
against some of the same bandits guilty of the previous
crimes. I was not sure of it in the case of Jim Reardon,
who had a personal grievance, or a fancied one, to
avenge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not too late to cancel the shipment, Carter, or
defer it for a few days,&rdquo; Judge Barclay suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That should be done, I think,&rdquo; Burdick added.</p>
<p>But Nick Carter quickly objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;That is the worst step
you could take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we now have an unusual advantage over these
rascals, in that we have anticipated their designs, and
now is the time to catch them red-handed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; Chick agreed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rare opportunity. It
is one that should not be lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is something in that, Carter, after all,&rdquo; Burdick
thoughtfully admitted. &ldquo;We can easily protect the
shipment by concealing a posse of well-armed men in the
express car. How will that do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do at all,&rdquo; Nick replied. &ldquo;The crooks might
discover the fact and throw up the job. They are not
working blindly, Mr. Burdick, nor in the dark. Being
absolutely ignorant of their identity, moreover, you
might reveal your intentions to some man who would
betray you. You must leave this matter entirely to me.
I want the rascals to undertake the job. I&rsquo;ll be on hand
to prevent it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;You may safely depend on him, Burdick,&rdquo; put in Judge
Barclay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are your plans, Mr. Carter?&rdquo; President Burdick
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Nick said frankly. &ldquo;I have not laid
any plans, nor shall I until I get all of the information
I can obtain. All I want of you, Mr. Burdick, is to
answer a few questions for me. I then will do the
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. I will leave it to you, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will make no mistake,&rdquo; Nick confidently predicted.
&ldquo;Now, to begin with, how is the money to be
shipped? It will be in the express car, I infer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, certainly, locked in the safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who has charge of the car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man named Daniel Cady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reliable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until the last gun is fired,&rdquo; said Burdick emphatically.
&ldquo;I know him root and branch, Carter, and he has both
judgment and courage. He would fight to the last ditch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he run alone on the car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. The night run does not ordinarily require a second
man. The express carriage on that particular train
is never very heavy. Cady has had charge of that car
for a dozen years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does he live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His home is here, in Shelby. He has a wife and
several children. He now is in Philadelphia, however, for
he goes and returns on alternate nights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;What time is the express
due in North Dayton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twelve o&rsquo;clock precisely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it stop there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at the station. It stops at the junction of our
western division south of the town to take water and
get instructions from Sampson, the train dispatcher
here in Shelby. It is the last stop the limited makes
before reaching Shelby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A run of eighteen miles, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the next stop north?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amherst, fourteen miles beyond North Dayton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a block-signal tower at the North Dayton
Junction, I infer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is the night operator?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom Denny, a very reliable man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capital!&rdquo; said Nick promptly. &ldquo;Write a line introducing
me to Denny and directing him to co&ouml;perate with
me. I shall require nothing, President Burdick, that will
interfere with his customary duties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give you a letter to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also one to Daniel Cady,&rdquo; added Nick. &ldquo;Make it of
the same character. I am probably a stranger to both
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>President Burdick turned to his desk and wrote the two
letters, then handed them to the detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that is all,&rdquo; said Nick, taking his hat. &ldquo;By
the way, however, what time does the next north-bound
train leave Shelby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At five-thirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it stop at North Dayton and Amherst?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, both stations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; Nick repeated, rising. &ldquo;Do absolutely
nothing more in this matter, gentlemen, but leave it all
to me. I will contrive to thwart these rascals and land
them behind prison bars. Come, Chick, we must get a
move on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your scheme?&rdquo; Chick inquired, when they
emerged up the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That can be briefly told,&rdquo; Nick replied. &ldquo;Martin, whoever
he is, evidently is in Philadelphia, where he probably
learned about the money shipment and most likely he
was there with that object in view. It is almost a safe
gamble, too, that he will be on the Southern Limited to-night,
since his letter to Dewitt states that he will see
the latter after the robbery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you,&rdquo; Chick nodded. &ldquo;It does look, indeed,
as if he would be on the train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What part he will play in the robbery, however, is
an open question,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;He may take no active
part in it, as far as that goes, but may leave the work
to his confederates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have, of course, no idea just when, where, or
how the job will be attempted,&rdquo; Nick continued. &ldquo;The
letter states, however, that there will be nothing doing
until the train is south of North Dayton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The job will be undertaken, then, somewhere in the
run of eighteen miles to Shelby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thinking they have a walk-over, as Martin terms it,
the rascals may be overconfident,&rdquo; Nick added. &ldquo;I think
we can foil them, however, and get them with hands
up. I will leave Patsy to trail Dewitt to cover, if possible,
while we tackle the train end of the job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what do you make of the other statements in
Martin&rsquo;s letter?&rdquo; Chick inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to having a substitute down fine by that time
and the other dead to rights?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. What do you make of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That seems open to only one interpretation,&rdquo; Nick
reasoned. &ldquo;It probably refers to the package containing
the money. A substitute evidently is to be used in some
way, and the other taken from the express car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That seems like a reasonable theory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The money certainly is to be on the car, however,
for Dewitt is directed to be on hand to relieve some one
of the goods, possibly Martin himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, as the letter also states, nothing is to be done
until after leaving North Dayton,&rdquo; Nick repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your plans?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will leave town in disguise at five-thirty. You
go as far as Amherst, to board the express when it arrives.
You must be governed by the make-up of the
train as to what car you will take. Select that which
Martin would be most likely to occupy, and be on the
lookout for him, or for any other suspicious circumstances.
There is a fourteen-mile run before you arrive
in North Dayton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand, Nick, and will be governed accordingly,&rdquo;
Chick assured him. &ldquo;But what are your own designs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to board that express car at North Dayton,&rdquo;
said Nick, with rather grim intonation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll contrive to
do so in a way that will occasion no misgivings, even if
I am seen by some of the gang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Predictions beyond that point would be speculative.
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
I will make only one. If Cady proves to be the man
of nerve and courage ascribed to him by President Burdick&mdash;well,
in that case, Chick, if this bunch of bandits
gets away with the money, I&rsquo;ll chuck my vocation and
open an old man&rsquo;s home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chick Carter laughed.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV.</span>
<br />THE REAL SUBSTITUTE.</h2>
<p>It was a clear night with a myriad of stars in the sky.
The silver crescent of a quarter moon had sunk below
the wooded hills in the west. A chill from the distant
mountains was in the air, though but little wind was
stirring.</p>
<p>The midnight stillness of the rural country south of
North Dayton, where the lofty signal tower loomed up
at the junction of the western division of the S. &amp; O.
Railway, was broken only by the frequent croakings
of frogs in a swamp east of the tracks, or the occasional
cry of some night bird circling overhead.</p>
<p>The N. D. tower, as it was known on the wire, was in
a lonely locality. Trains stopped there only for water,
or in response to the signal lights, which changed from
green and red to white when the night operator, Tom
Denny, worked the huge levers in the tower chamber.</p>
<p>He was seated at his telegraph stand shortly before
twelve on that eventful night, a compact, muscular man
of middle age. A revolver was lying near the instrument.</p>
<p>The murder in the K. C. tower at Shelby, the brutal
killing of Karl Glidden, also the other crimes and the
outrages along the S. &amp; O. road&mdash;all were so fresh in
the mind of every night operator during his weary vigil,
that none was taking any chances of being caught unprepared.</p>
<p>Three bells suddenly broke the stillness of the tower
chamber. They told Denny that the operator in the next
tower north was waiting for his unlock, that the Southern
Limited was approaching North Dayton, and Denny
pushed the plug into the box and held it for an O. K.
Getting it almost instantly, he arose and set his signals.</p>
<p>As he turned from the lever, he heard a step on the
tower stairs. As quick as a flash, while a hand was
laid on the knob of the door, Denny stepped to the table
and seized his revolver.</p>
<p>The door was opened and a roughly clad, bearded man
appeared on the threshold. He looked like a track hand,
or one employed on the railway. He was a stranger to
Denny, however, who covered him instantly, crying
sharply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on! Stop right there! What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick Carter smiled and said quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few words with you, Denny, nothing more. I have
a letter of introduction from President Burdick. It will
tell you who I am and why I am here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Denny appeared incredulous and suspicious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay where you are!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;Toss me the
letter, then hands up while I read it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick obeyed, remarking, with a laugh:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right, Denny. He will be a good man, indeed,
who catches you napping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Denny read the brief letter, all the while with one eye
upon the intruder. He had no doubt of Nick&rsquo;s identity,
however, after reading the missive and seeing the familiar
handwriting of the railway president.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove, you gave me a disagreeable surprise to start
with, Mr. Carter, but this more than makes up for it,&rdquo;
he said heartily, placing the letter and weapon upon the
table and extending his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough,&rdquo; Nick replied, entering and shaking
hands with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can, indeed, guess why you are here,&rdquo; Denny added.
&ldquo;It is something in connection with your efforts to run
down the railway bandits. I at first thought you were
one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite naturally, Denny, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; smiled the detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you are in the employ of the road, of
course, since you cornered Jim Reardon and sent him
after his victim. But what&rsquo;s your mission here to-night?
How can I be of any help to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick knew that he could safely confide in him, and he
then briefly informed him of the circumstances and of
the steps he was taking to prevent the suspected robbery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to board the express car without incurring
suspicions, Denny, in case any of the gang are on the
watch during this last stop of the train, before the job
is to be attempted,&rdquo; Nick proceeded to explain. &ldquo;I can
do so, all right, by pretending to be a track hand and
in the employ of the road. No observer seeing me come
down from the signal tower would think it strange for me
to board the car as if to ride to Shelby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely not,&rdquo; Denny quickly agreed. &ldquo;That frequently
occurs. You look the part to the letter, too, Mr. Carter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to be with Cady in the car during the run,&rdquo;
Nick added. &ldquo;I will, I think, show these bandits that
their knavery will be far from a walk-over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said Denny, smiling. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find Cady
all right, too, and game to the core. He&rsquo;s one man in
a thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Burdick informed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one has anything on Cady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you consistently leave the tower after the train
arrives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, while the engine is taking water. I
nearly always have dispatches to take down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capital! Go down with me to the express car, then,
and pretend that you know me to be a track hand and
that I have a right to ride with Cady. I wish to get into
the car without any display of opposition on his part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix you, Mr. Carter, as far as that goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is all I will require of you,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;I
will explain to Cady after the train leaves here. How
soon is it due?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In about five minutes,&rdquo; said Denny, glancing at a
clock on the wall. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll slip on my coat and be ready
to go down with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; Nick said approvingly. &ldquo;Pay no attention
to any persons who may be on the platform, or
step from the train during the stop. An inquisitive stare
might cause misgivings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wise, Mr. Carter,&rdquo; Denny assured him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do
precisely as if I knew nothing about this deviltry. I&rsquo;m
over seven, you know, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was interrupted by the sudden, rapid ticking of the
telegraph instrument. It proved to be a dispatch for
the engineer of the coming train, and Denny scarce had
transcribed it when the whistle of the locomotive sounded
in the near distance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>Half a minute later the glare of its headlight appeared
amid the scattered lights of the town, from which it
emerged at high speed and immediately began slowing
down to make the junction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; Denny cried, leading the way. &ldquo;She stops
only five minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick followed him from the chamber and down the
long flight of stairs from the tower. He could feel the
structure trembling under the vibrations caused by the
heavy train, which then was approaching the long platform
and coming to a stop, amid the clanging of the
locomotive bell, the furious hissing of steam, and the
grinding of the brakes.</p>
<p>Only a solitary man was pacing the platform, carrying
a traveler&rsquo;s grip and a light overcoat. Nick saw at a
glance that he was a commercial drummer and not
worthy of suspicion.</p>
<p>Several men stepped from the train, obviously to break
the monotony of a night journey, but neither the looks
or actions of any appeared suspicious. Nick quickly noted
the make-up of the train, a baggage car, the express
car, a smoker, an ordinary passenger car, and two Pullman
sleepers in the rear. He knew that Chick was on
the train, but he did not know just where, nor particularly
care at that moment.</p>
<p>Denny ran to the locomotive and gave the engineer the
dispatch, then hurriedly rejoined Nick and led the way
to the express car.</p>
<p>The sliding side door was thrown open from within
while they approached, and Denny quickly greeted the
man who appeared in the brightly lighted car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Cady, old chap!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right
on time to-night, all right. Here&rsquo;s Jack Dakin, track
hand, who will ride with you to Shelby. He missed the
last local. You don&rsquo;t know him, I reckon, but he&rsquo;s all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ride with me?&rdquo; questioned Cady, sharply regarding
both.</p>
<p>He was a well-built man of middle age, of sandy complexion,
and wearing a full beard. He was clad in
blouse and overalls, with a woolen cap pulled over his
brow.</p>
<p>Nick did not wait for him to make any objections. He
grasped the edge of the door and drew himself up from
the platform, saying quietly, while he entered the car:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Cady. I&rsquo;ve got a letter to you from
President Burdick. Don&rsquo;t oppose me. Pretend this is
nothing unusual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cady seemed to grasp the situation. A fiery gleam
appeared for a moment in the depths of his gray eyes,
but he drew back to make room for Nick, replying, in
quick whispers:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up? There&rsquo;s nothing wrong, is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait until we leave here. Don&rsquo;t question,&rdquo; cautioned
Nick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Cady,&rdquo; Denny quickly assured him, leaning
in through the open door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough, then,&rdquo; Cady nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your
word for it, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick had strode across the car and seated himself
on a packing case, one of several that evidently had been
shipped by express and which occupied one side of the
car. He noticed that the door of a safe in one corner
was closed, and the handle indicated that the safe was
properly locked and the combination scattered. He felt
reasonably sure that he could, with the help of Dan
Cady and Chick, foil and arrest any gang that would
attempt the robbery.</p>
<p>The clanging of the locomotive bell told that the
train was about to start.</p>
<p>Passengers on the platform scampered toward the cars
from which they had emerged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long, Cady!&rdquo; cried Denny, while he hastened
toward the tower stairs.</p>
<p>Cady responded with a gesture and then closed and
secured the door of the express car.</p>
<p>A backward jolt, a jangling of bumpers and couplings,
a furious hissing of steam, followed by the labored puffing
of the locomotive, and the train made way and the lonely
junction with its platform and the signal tower were
quickly left behind, grim and silent in the twilight of
the starry night.</p>
<p>Nick Carter then lost no time in explaining the situation,
the outcome of which was far from what he expected,
yet what no mortal man could have anticipated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Cady, I&rsquo;ll put you wise to what&rsquo;s in the wind,&rdquo;
said he, rising from the case on which he was seated.
&ldquo;Here is the letter from President Burdick that will tell
you who I am, and a word will explain why I am
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cady opened the letter and read it, then gazed more
sharply at the detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, say, this is some surprise,&rdquo; he said bluntly.
&ldquo;I did not dream that you were Nick Carter, though I
knew you were in the employ of the road. Do you suspect
something wrong to-night, Mr. Carter, that you have
boarded my car in this way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than suspect,&rdquo; Nick replied. &ldquo;You are carrying
a money package of sixty thousand dollars, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Carter, I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Locked in the safe, sir, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; Nick nodded. &ldquo;It will be up to you and
me, Cady, to prevent a bunch of bandits from removing
it from the safe. Not only to prevent them, Cady, but
also to corner and arrest them. Are you game for such
an undertaking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cady continued to look Nick straight in the eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Game, sir!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You bet I&rsquo;m game. If
they get that money, Mr. Carter, they&rsquo;ll get it over my
dead body. But why do you suspect anything of the
kind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick briefly informed him, and the bearded face of the
express-car man took on a more serious expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you got wise to all that from the two telegrams?&rdquo;
he said inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Nick nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a keen man, Mr. Carter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, Mr. Cady. It&rsquo;s a part of my business to
detect such things when they come my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What other steps have you taken to prevent this
job?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of importance,&rdquo; Nick said evasively. &ldquo;I think
that you and I, Cady, will be able to prevent it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, sir, as far as that goes,&rdquo; Cady quickly agreed.
&ldquo;Do you know just where and how it is to be attempted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not how, Cady, but somewhere between here and
Shelby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have not long to wait, then,&rdquo; Cady declared. &ldquo;We
make the run from North Dayton in twenty-six minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have covered about eight miles. We are in Willow
Creek section, a mighty lonely locality, and the next place
near which we pass is Benton Corners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Benton Corners!&rdquo; Nick echoed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I
rounded up Jim Reardon, and where Jake Hanlon, Link
Magee, and Dick Bryan live. I suspected them of having
been Reardon&rsquo;s confederates, but we could not convict
them. It may be, by Jove, that they are engaged in
this job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite likely. They certainly are bad eggs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know them, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By name and sight,&rdquo; Cady nodded. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll be
ready for them. You are armed, sir, of course, and I
have a revolver in the safe. I&rsquo;ll get it and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, don&rsquo;t unlock the safe,&rdquo; Nick quickly objected.
&ldquo;The job may be attempted at any moment. I
have two revolvers. Take one of them and be ready to
hold up the rascals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be ready,&rdquo; Cady declared, taking the weapon.
&ldquo;Throw up your hands, Carter, and be darned quick
about it, or you&rsquo;ll get a slug of lead from your own
weapon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick Carter was never more surprised in his life.</p>
<p>Cady had turned the revolver squarely upon the detective,
and there was a gleam in his eyes, a vicious ring
in his voice, denoting that he meant what he said.</p>
<p>No sane man would have ignored them, and Nick threw
up his hands. They stood confronting one another in
the swaying car, these two men, Cady with a murderous
look on his bearded face, the detective with an expression
of sudden terrible sternness, mingled with surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this, Cady?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;I was told that
you were true blue and a man of courage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to believe all you&rsquo;re told,&rdquo; Cady snarled
back at him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t drop your hands, Carter, or I&rsquo;ll drop
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you in with this gang?&rdquo; Nick sternly questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet I&rsquo;m in with it. I&rsquo;m out to get this coin&mdash;and
to get you, now, since you know so much about&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car lurched suddenly on a curve.</p>
<p>The revolver covering the detective&rsquo;s breast deviated for
a moment, as Cady swayed under the sudden lurch.</p>
<p>It was the moment for which Nick Carter was watching.
He was as quick as a flash in seeing and seizing the opportunity.
His left hand shot downward and grasped
the miscreant&rsquo;s wrist, turning the revolver aside, while
his right shot out and closed with a viselike grip around
Cady&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In with this gang, are you?&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;You shall
pay the price, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But again the unexpected occurred. Another lurch of
the car threw both men, then engaged in the terrible
struggle, against the wall of the car.</p>
<p>Cady&rsquo;s beard was torn off and the truth revealed&mdash;the
man was not Cady.</p>
<p>It was not a substitute package to which the telegram
had referred, but&mdash;a substitute man!</p>
<p>Something like a half-smothered oath broke from the
detective. He swung the struggling ruffian around and
forced him against the wall of the swaying car. He could
have overcome him and crushed him within half a minute&mdash;if
help had not been at hand.</p>
<p>All transpired, in fact, in far less time than half a
minute.</p>
<p>The covers of two of the packing cases flew upward.</p>
<p>Out of each case leaped a man.</p>
<p>A bludgeon in the hand of one fell squarely on Nick&rsquo;s
head.</p>
<p>The fist of the other caught him on the jaw.</p>
<p>A blow from the supposed Cady landed over his heart.</p>
<p>And under this combined assault, made with all the
vicious energy of utter desperation, Nick Carter sank to
the floor of the reeling car, bleeding and insensible, with
every muscle relaxed.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER V.</span>
<br />NIGHT WORK.</h2>
<p>Chick Carter, in accord with the plans laid out by Nick,
was in Amherst that evening in the disguise of a traveling
salesman. He was waiting on the station platform when
the Southern Limited arrived.</p>
<p>Chick sized up the train as it rolled into the station.
He did not definitely know, of course, whether the crook
who had sent the telegram from Philadelphia was among
the passengers, but he strongly suspected that he was,
and he also knew that Nick would board the express car
at North Dayton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the crook is on the train and intends to take any
active part in the robbery, it&rsquo;s ten to one that he is in
the ordinary passenger car,&rdquo; Chick reasoned. &ldquo;He certainly
would not be in a sleeper. He would reason, too,
that he would be less liable to suspicion than if he rode in
the smoker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chick acted upon these theories. He entered the next
car back of the smoker, the latter being back of the express
and baggage cars, and he took one of the rear
seats, from which he could see most of the other occupants
of the car. It was about two-thirds filled with
men and women, traveling singly or in couples.</p>
<p>Chick pretended to have no interest in any of them.
None, nevertheless, escaped his furtive scrutiny during the
run of fourteen miles to North Dayton. He could discover
none, however, whose looks or actions seemed to
warrant suspicion.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes took the train to North Dayton.</p>
<p>Gazing furtively from the window, Chick saw the lights
in the signal tower, saw Nick and Denny hasten down
the stairs, saw Denny return alone just as the train was
starting, which convinced him that Nick then was in the
express car, as planned.</p>
<p>Two men who had briefly left the train returned to the
car in which Chick was seated. He was a keen reader
of faces. He saw plainly enough that neither of the
men was a crook, or at least no such crook as he was
seeking.</p>
<p>The train rushed on through the starry night.</p>
<p>Chick knew that the time was rapidly approaching when,
if Nick&rsquo;s deductions were correct, the robbery would be
attempted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not cut much ice here,&rdquo; he said to himself, at
length. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll take a look at the occupants of the
smoker. That will bring me nearer the express car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was about to do so when his attention was drawn
to a couple three seats in front of him and on the opposite
side of the aisle.</p>
<p>One was a respectable-looking, well-dressed man of
forty, with grave, dark eyes and a Vandyke beard.</p>
<p>His companion was an attractive woman of about thirty
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
years old, with a fair complexion and an abundance of
light-brown hair. Her fine figure was clad in a tailor-made
traveling costume of bottle green. They were about
the last couple in the car to have invited suspicion.</p>
<p>The train had begun to labor on a steep up grade.</p>
<p>The man with a Vandyke beard drew out a cigar and
bit the end from it, then said a few words to the woman.
She bowed and smiled, revealing a double row of white
teeth, and the man arose with a backward glance and
smiled at her, then went into the smoker.</p>
<p>Chick watched him thoughtfully, but not suspiciously,
when he strode through the aisle and out of the car.
Plainly enough, it appeared, the man had excused himself
politely to his companion in order to go for a smoke.
It appeared like the act of a gentleman.</p>
<p>Chick felt no immediate impulse to follow him, and
his attention was again drawn toward the woman. She
was moving to a position nearer the lamps, and was
spreading a newspaper to read it.</p>
<p>Chick saw that it was a Philadelphia newspaper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove, they evidently came from Philadelphia,&rdquo; he
said to himself. &ldquo;Can it be that they&mdash;no, no, that seems
quite improbable. No man engaged in a train robbery,
or with any interest in one, would be traveling with
a woman. Besides, neither looks like a crook, but quite
the contrary. She may have bought the paper on the
train, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chick&rsquo;s train of thought took a sudden, startling turn.</p>
<p>A brakeman went rushing through the aisle in the direction
of the smoking car.</p>
<p>Chick noticed now that the train was rapidly slowing
down. He heard shouts from the smoker when the brakeman
opened the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great guns!&rdquo; he muttered, starting up and following
him. &ldquo;Has the trick been turned? Has the job been
done, in spite of us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chick hurried through the car and entered the smoker.
A dozen excited men were gathered near the forward
door and upon the platform and steps. In another moment
Chick was among them, and he saw at a glance what had
occurred.</p>
<p>The train had been divided. The rear cars of it had
come to a stop on the steep up grade.</p>
<p>The forward section, consisting of the locomotive, the
baggage car, and the express car, was vanishing around a
curve in the tracks more than half a mile away.</p>
<p>A solitary man then was on the rear platform of
the express car, though invisible in the darkness&mdash;the man
with a Vandyke beard.</p>
<p>Scarce two minutes had elapsed since he passed through
the smoker. He had not sat down, nor lighted his cigar,
but walked deliberately out upon the front platform.</p>
<p>Then, with the speed and dexterity of one familiar with
such work, he disconnected the signal cord and the air-brake
couplings, set the front brake of the smoker, and
then unlocked and threw the lever that uncoupled the two
cars. Then he leaped to the back platform of the express
car just as it forged ahead, leaving the rear section of
the broken train falling swiftly behind.</p>
<p>Leaning out from the platform steps to make absolutely
sure of his location, the man then waited until the forward
section struck the curve mentioned. He then seized
the bell cord and signaled the engineer to stop.</p>
<p>The response was immediate. Almost on the instant the
grinding of the brakes was mingled with the roar and
rumble of the wheels and the rush of the night wind
around him.</p>
<p>Gazing toward the desolate wooded country on the right,
he saw that he had timed the desperate work to a nicety.</p>
<p>Three quick flashes of light met his gaze, coming from
a point in the woods scarce twenty feet from the railway.
He turned and banged twice on the car door with the
butt of his revolver.</p>
<p>The three men within were awaiting the signal. The
sliding door of the car then was opened. So was the
door of the safe. A large leather bag, nearly as large as
a letter pouch, was lying on the floor.</p>
<p>Near by, gagged and securely bound, lay Nick Carter,
still insensible. One of his assailants of only a few minutes
before, now hearing the expected signal, yelled excitedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out with him, Mauler! The roadbed is sandy. Out
with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy be hanged!&rdquo; shouted Mauler, the miscreant who
had impersonated Cady. &ldquo;It may be lucky for us if his
neck is broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rolled the detective&rsquo;s inanimate form from the
car while speaking, and it vanished into the gloom outside.</p>
<p>The large leather pouch quickly followed.</p>
<p>The car was steadily slowing down.</p>
<p>There was a bang on the front door&mdash;but the door was
locked and barricaded.</p>
<p>One after another of three men leaped from the car.
The man on the rear platform sprang down and joined
them.</p>
<p>They ran back over the roadbed, while the deserted car
surged onward for nearly fifty yards before stopping,
before the engineer and baggage hands began a more
active and energetic investigation.</p>
<p>The four men then were a hundred yards down the
track, invisible in the faint starlight at that distance.
Other figures appeared from amid the gloomy woods.
The burdens lying on the roadbed, one more than the
scoundrels had figured upon, were quickly seized and
removed&mdash;into the depths of the forest that flanked the
railway for miles in that locality.</p>
<p>Much can be quickly accomplished by determined men
under such desperate circumstances.</p>
<p>Only eight minutes had passed since the Southern Limited
had left North Dayton.</p>
<p>Something like three minutes later, Chick Carter, followed
by half a score of men anxious to learn what had
occurred, came running up the track and joined the engineer
and other train hands then gathered in and around
the looted express car.</p>
<p>Chick saw at a glance that the trick had, indeed, been
turned; also that Nick Carter was missing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great guns!&rdquo; he exclaimed to himself. &ldquo;This is
strange, mighty strange, and where in thunder is Cady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chick decided to listen briefly before revealing his
identity and what he knew about the case, a self-restraint
which few would have had under such circumstances, and
he very soon determined to say nothing.</p>
<p>For the engineer and train hands, familiar with the
desolate section of the country, quickly came to two
conclusions; one, that Cady had been overcome by the
robbers who had been concealed in the empty packing
cases; the other, that he had been carried away with the
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
plunder from the open safe by a gang of desperadoes
whom it would be useless to pursue at that time.</p>
<p>Chick knew that they were mistaken, and he also felt
sure that he could accomplish nothing then and there.
The evidence in the car showed him plain enough that
Nick had been overcome by the bandits, and he realized
that any attempt at immediate pursuit would be worse
than futile.</p>
<p>He sprang into the express car, when the conductor
insisted that he must run on to Shelby, and the cars
were first run back to couple on the rear section of the
broken train.</p>
<p>Chick returned to his seat in the car which he had
occupied from Amherst.</p>
<p>The blond woman, apparently wearied by the delay, and
with no interest in the occasion for it, seemed to have
fallen asleep over her newspaper.</p>
<p>Chick Carter noticed her again soon after resuming his
seat, and he was suddenly hit with an idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By thunder!&rdquo; he mentally exclaimed. &ldquo;What has become
of her companion? Can he have been in the smoker
all the while? No, not by a long chalk! He would not
have left her here asleep, if she really is asleep. He would
have returned to tell her about the robbery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! there&rsquo;s nothing to this,&rdquo; he abruptly decided.
&ldquo;I have had that Philadelphia crook under my very eye,
this woman&rsquo;s companion, the fellow with a Vandyke beard.
He must have bolted with the gang, too, or I should have
seen him on the railway, or in the smoker. All this will
be a cinch, by Jove, unless he shows up before we reach
Shelby. I&rsquo;m glad I kept my trap closed. My identity is
not suspected, and I will have a clew worth following&mdash;the
woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently, moving from side to side, selecting such
persons as hit his fancy, the conductor came through
the car and took the names and addresses of several
people, explaining that witnesses might be wanted in a
later investigation, who were not in the employ of the
railway company.</p>
<p>The woman was among those whom he questioned. She
yawned and looked up at him with a frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; she declined, a bit curtly. &ldquo;I do not wish
to be brought into an investigation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may not be necessary, after all,&rdquo; said the conductor
suavely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I know nothing about the affair, except that the
train stopped and that a robbery is said to have been committed,&rdquo;
the woman objected. &ldquo;Besides, my home is in
Philadelphia, and it would not be convenient for me
to be summoned to an investigation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would be excused, no doubt, in that case,&rdquo; persisted
the conductor. &ldquo;Surely, madam, you have no other
reason for refusing to give me your name and address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No other reason!&rdquo; she exclaimed impatiently. &ldquo;Certainly
not, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kindly do so, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman hesitated for another moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove, she is deciding whether to give him a fictitious
name,&rdquo; thought Chick, intently watching her frowning
face. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll not be fool enough to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chick was right.</p>
<p>The woman decided nearly as quickly as he that deception
at that time might later make her liable to serious
suspicion. She drew herself up a bit haughtily and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, since you insist upon it. My name is
Janet Payson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; smiled the conductor. &ldquo;And your address?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. 20 Martin Street, Philadelphia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conductor bowed and moved on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martin Street,&rdquo; thought Chick, instantly recalling the
signature on the Dalton telegram. &ldquo;Martin fits in here,
all right. She told the truth, and I&rsquo;ve picked up a very
proper lead. It&rsquo;s not such a long, long way to Tipperary,
after all. We shall see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman left the train at Shelby, carrying only a
suit case, and she accosted a cabman outside of the
station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shelby House,&rdquo; she directed curtly.</p>
<p>Chick was at her elbow and heard her.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later he read her name inscribed on the
hotel register: &ldquo;Miss Janet Payson, Philadelphia.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI.</span>
<br />HOW PATSY MADE GOOD.</h2>
<p>It was one o&rsquo;clock when Chick Carter entered his
room in the Shelby House. He removed his coat, hat,
and disguise, then lit a cigar and sat down to size up
the circumstances and the evidence he had found in the
express car.</p>
<p>How was the robbery committed? How did Cady
figure in it, and what became of him? How had Nick
been overcome, and why had he been carried away by
the bandits, assuming that he had not been killed and
thrown from the car?</p>
<p>Chick did not believe the last. He would have seen
the body when hastening up the tracks. He knew that
these crooks would commit murder only as a last resort,
moreover, and the evidence in the car did not point to
bloodshed and murder.</p>
<p>Chick felt reasonably sure, in fact, that Nick was alive
and in the hands of the desperadoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two empty packing cases and an open safe, opened by
means of the combination,&rdquo; he mused intently. &ldquo;No force
apparent except what must have been required to get the
best of Nick and Cady. But could two men concealed in
packing cases, and the cases could not have contained
more than two, have overcome two such men as Nick
and Cady? By Jove, it doesn&rsquo;t seem possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor could Janet Payson&rsquo;s companion have had any
hand in the work done in the express car. He would have
had time only to disconnect the train, which he certainly
went forward to do. All that was cut and dried, previously
planned, and it was done by a man expert at such
work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible, then, that Cady is in league with these
crooks? Did he hold up Nick and get him with the
help of his hidden confederates? Did he open the safe?
Did he substitute&mdash;stop one moment! By Jove, there was
no substitute money package in the car, nor in the safe,
or I must surely have seen it. I made a thorough
inspection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chick&rsquo;s brows knit closer under the mental concentration
with which he strove to fathom the conflicting
circumstances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That special-delivery letter certainly mentioned a substitute.
It read, I remember distinctly: &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll have the
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
substitute down fine in ample time and the other dead
to rights.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m, that&rsquo;s not so clear, in view of what has occurred
and the fact that no substitute money package was
found in the car. It certainly is worded a bit oddly.
To have one dead to rights is a term usually applied to a
situation, a gang, or a man; not to a parcel, package, or
anything of that kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove, it may in this case have been a man. The
substitute may have been a man in place of Cady. That
would explain Cady&rsquo;s disappearance from the car. A man
made up to perfectly resemble Cady&mdash;that&rsquo;s it, by gracious,
as sure as I&rsquo;m a foot high,&rdquo; Chick decided. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why
Martin worded the letter in that way, that he&rsquo;d have a
substitute down fine, in ample time. A substitute to take
Cady&rsquo;s place in the express car&mdash;that&rsquo;s what!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chick&rsquo;s countenance had lighted. Through this process
of reasoning he had deduced the one fact, the one crafty
subterfuge, that had made the robbery possible under all
of the other known circumstances.</p>
<p>It told Chick, too, how easily confederates of the substitute
rascal could have been concealed in the car, and
how easily Nick could have been held up and overcome
under such unexpected adverse conditions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what has become of Cady?&rdquo; Chick next asked himself.
&ldquo;He was supposed to be in Philadelphia, of course,
in order to make this run. By Jove, I have it! Got him
dead to rights, eh? I&rsquo;ll see about that. I&rsquo;ll set another
ball rolling in this game&mdash;one that may knock out a ten-strike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chick sprang up with the last and hastened down to the
hotel office. Entering a telephone booth and closing the
door, he called up the central exchange and learned that
he could quickly get a clear wire to Philadelphia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want the police headquarters,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The officer
in charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chick had waited only seven minutes, when the operator
rang him up and announced:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; Chick called. &ldquo;Police headquarters, Philadelphia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Distance did not serve to soften the strong, sonorous
voice. The wire carried the sound perfectly. The voice
was a familiar one to the detective, that of an old friend
in police circles, and Chick laughed audibly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to recognize a voice that rings true,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;How are you, Lieutenant Lang?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; came the answer. &ldquo;But who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chickering Carter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ho! Chick, eh?&rdquo; Lang&rsquo;s sonorous laugh could
be heard. &ldquo;Glad to hear from you. Where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On a case down Shelby way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard that Nick was in that section. Something
doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty, Lang, and then some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That just about suits you, I suppose. How can I aid
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want hurry-up information about a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Janet Payson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not have to wait long,&rdquo; cried Lang, laughing.
&ldquo;I can supply you right off the reel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Chick cried. &ldquo;Do you know her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only professionally,&rdquo; Lang responded. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s pretty
well known here by the boys in brass buttons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about her, Ned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fly!&rdquo; Lang said tersely. &ldquo;As fly as one often meets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A crook?&rdquo; Chick inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crooked, but not a crook. I don&rsquo;t know that she has
ever been arrested. She devotes her attractions to bleeding
any easy mark that comes her way. She is known
here as Jaunty Janet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you,&rdquo; said Chick. &ldquo;Do you know where she
lives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fat question. What am I on the force for?&rdquo;
Lang cried, laughing. &ldquo;She has a ground-floor flat in
Martin Street, No. 20.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Correct!&rdquo; Chick exclaimed. &ldquo;Do you know anything
about her male friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen. I want you to do something for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come across with it, Chick, and consider it done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Telegraph me the result. Address me in care of the
Shelby House.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do so. What&rsquo;s wanted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chick told him and returned to his room, at the door
of which he now found&mdash;Patsy Garvan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! I&rsquo;ve been on nettles for an hour, ever since the
Southern Limited arrived,&rdquo; Patsy impatiently declared,
after greeting him. &ldquo;I was at the station and heard about
the robbery, but I saw nothing of you, or the chief, and
I figured that you both were in wrong, for fair. What&rsquo;s
become of the chief? I&rsquo;ve been here twice in search of
you. Couldn&rsquo;t you head off the job? What do you want
for a starter? Why didn&rsquo;t you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut it! Cut it!&rdquo; Chick interrupted. &ldquo;Bridle your
tongue, or you&rsquo;ll ask more questions than I could answer
before daylight. Hit up a cigar and give me time to explain.
You&rsquo;re not all the mustard in the pot. Didn&rsquo;t you
know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I know it,&rdquo; retorted Patsy. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m some mustard,
all the same, with a dash of tabasco thrown in.
What&rsquo;s eating you, anyway? Send for an ice bag and cool
your block. Your hair may wilt with the heat and look
like dead grass. You&rsquo;d be a bird, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chick laughed and lit another cigar.</p>
<p>It was two in the morning, mind you, and both had been
busy and on their nerves for eighteen hours, a sufficient
excuse for impatience and irritability, which really had no
sting.</p>
<p>Patsy grinned and sat down, taking a brier pipe from
his pocket and deliberately filling it. Not until he had
lit it and wafted a cloud of smoke toward the ceiling
did he speak again, and then he stared at Chick and said
simply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chick settled back in his chair and told him what had
occurred.</p>
<p>Patsy&rsquo;s face then had lost its sphinxlike expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whiz!&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;Say, Chick, old top, this
isn&rsquo;t so bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on with it,&rdquo; Chick replied, knowing he had something
to report. &ldquo;What have you learned that&rsquo;s worth
knowing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worth knowing&mdash;that&rsquo;s my long suit with four honors,&rdquo;
said Patsy. &ldquo;I never pick up thirteen measly duckers,
no matter who deals the papes. Say, Chick, old chap,
listen!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, eh? What do you think I&rsquo;m doing? Do I look
like a lay figure with wax ears? I am listening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patsy ended his levity and drew up in his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know whose trail I have been on&mdash;that of Gus
Dewitt,&rdquo; he said earnestly. &ldquo;I got the chief&rsquo;s telephone
spiel from the post office, which put me wise to what
that special-delivery letter contained, and that was the
last I knew of his suspicions and designs. But I had my
eye on Dewitt, all right, and I saw him receive the letter
and read it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; questioned Chick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He then made a move that nearly shook me off his
track,&rdquo; Patsy continued. &ldquo;He bolted straight for the
stable back of the Reddy House. He had a horse out
there tied under a shed, and he mounted him without a
word to any one and rode out of town as if a dozen
devil&rsquo;s imps were after him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knew why he went, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing, Chick, since I knew what was in the letter.
I knew he had gone to notify the gang that the job was
to be done to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; Chick nodded. &ldquo;There was nothing else
to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was enough more to it to keep me on the go
until nearly dark,&rdquo; Patsy protested. &ldquo;It was up to me to
trail him, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Chick smiled. &ldquo;I admit that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it didn&rsquo;t prove to be soft walking,&rdquo; Patsy resumed.
&ldquo;I got next to the hostler, two stable hands, and
a chauffeur, who hang around there, but they didn&rsquo;t
know him from a side of leather, except that his name was
Gus Dewitt and that he occasionally rode into town for
a day or an evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then a cabby showed up who remembered having
seen him ride in one night with Jake Hanlon, at whose
place we cornered Jim Reardon for the Glidden murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Benton Corners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; nodded Patsy. &ldquo;That, of course, put a bee in
my bonnet. I reasoned that, if Dewitt and Hanlon were
friends, both might be in this job, as well as those two
thoroughbred rascals who hang out at Hanlon&rsquo;s place, Dick
Bryan, and Link Magee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite likely, Patsy,&rdquo; Chick agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckoned, too, that Dewitt was heading for Benton
Corners, since he had taken that direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You went out there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I decided to take that chance, for I could see no other
way of trailing him. As I was leaving the stable yard,
however, I noticed the tracks left by his horse&rsquo;s hoofs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One had a little peculiarity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The shoe on the off fore hoof was different from
the others. It had a bar plate, and the mark of it showed
plainly wherever it struck yielding soil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I follow you,&rdquo; Chick nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I followed the tracks of that bar-plate shoe,&rdquo; said
Patsy. &ldquo;There were none in the paved streets, mind you,
but I hustled out to the road leading to Benton Corners,
and there I found the tracks again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knowing I might be mistaken, however, if I assumed
that Dewitt had gone to Hanlon&rsquo;s place, I decided to stick
to my trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wise decision, Patsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It took me some time to follow it, but it led me to
Hanlon&rsquo;s place, all right, and, after watching from the
woods back of the stable until late in the afternoon, I made
a discovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jake Hanlon showed up on horseback and rode into
the stable, and Dick Bryan came from the house and
joined him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the discovery, Patsy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bryan had it in his hand,&rdquo; said Patsy dryly. &ldquo;The
special-delivery letter and the disguise he had worn as
Gus Dewitt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bryan and Dewitt are the same, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and Dalton thrown in,&rdquo; declared Patsy. &ldquo;Bryan
has been posing in all three characters. He&rsquo;s a pretty
slick gink at that, too, I judge, from the confidence with
which he spoke when talking with Hanlon about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could hear what they were saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only for a few moments. Bryan showed him the letter
and the telegrams, and they then hurried into the house.
Out they came in about ten minutes, however, both with
revolvers and shotguns, and then they mounted their horses
and rode off to the north.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To join others of the gang, no doubt,&rdquo; said Chick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how I sized it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hanlon spoke of another crib, but he said nothing
definite, and I knew only the direction they took,&rdquo; Patsy
went on. &ldquo;I felt pretty sure that you and the chief would
head off the robbery, you see, so I hiked back to Shelby
to hunt you up and report. Now, hang it, I learn that
the job has been pulled off, and you think the chief is in
the hands of the rascals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have hardly a doubt of it,&rdquo; said Chick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be easy, then, to corner this gang and recover
their plunder,&rdquo; Patsy dubiously declared. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll know
we are after them and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not what you have discovered,&rdquo; put in Chick
pointedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. That may help some,&rdquo; Patsy allowed. &ldquo;If
we could only find out what other crib Hanlon meant
and where it is located, and devise some way to get there
before they can cover their tracks and dispose of Nick&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop a moment,&rdquo; Chick interrupted. &ldquo;I think we can
accomplish both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do?&rdquo; Patsy&rsquo;s countenance lighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly do. We&rsquo;ll put something over on these ruffians,
Patsy, that will have failed to enter their heads.
We&rsquo;ll get them, all right, take it from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean? Explain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull up here and listen,&rdquo; said Chick, tossing away his
cigar.</p>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII.</span>
<br />CHICK CARTER&rsquo;S CUNNING.</h2>
<p>Miss Janet Payson was seriously startled about ten
o&rsquo;clock the following morning, when a somewhat insistent
knock sounded on the door of her apartments in the
Shelby House.</p>
<p>The same was true of her companion, who had entered
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
about half an hour before, after leaving his touring car
in a neighboring street, in charge of a chauffeur and another
man, as if their mission was one that required
at least a moderate degree of caution.</p>
<p>Janet Payson&rsquo;s companion was the man with a Vandyke
beard&mdash;but he had removed it and slipped it into his pocket
since entering.</p>
<p>The removal of the disguise did not improve him. It
had served to hide a thin-lipped, sinister mouth, a bulldog
jaw and chin, and the hard lines of a desperate and
determined face.</p>
<p>That he was all that his face denoted, moreover, appeared
in the celerity with which he whipped out a revolver
from his hip pocket the instant the knock interrupted
the subdued conversation with the woman. At the
same time he muttered quickly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? Who the devil can that be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet Payson turned pale, or as pale as the tinge of rouge
in her cheeks permitted, and she laid her finger on her
lips, then pointed to the adjoining bedroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep quiet, Jeff,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man, Jefferson Murdock by name, seized his hat
and tiptoed into the bedroom and set the door ajar. Then
he waited and listened, revolver in hand.</p>
<p>The knock sounded again on the hall door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently,&rdquo; cried the woman. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tore open the collar of her waist while speaking,
receiving no reply, then stepped to the door and opened it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had not finished dressing,&rdquo; she said impatiently, hastening
to rehook the collar. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chick Carter was the person who had knocked, and
none would have recognized him. Though fairly well
clad and somewhat flashily, he had the sinister aspect of
an East Side tough, or a man capable of any covert
knavery.</p>
<p>Chick removed his hat and smiled, nevertheless, replying
as politely as one would have expected:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to talk with you for half a minute, or mebbe
longer, Miss Payson, if you&rsquo;re alone here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk with me?&rdquo; said Janet, with brows knitting. &ldquo;What
about, and who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Kennedy, Jim Kennedy, and I live in
Philadelphia,&rdquo; said Chick, dropping his voice suggestively.
&ldquo;I happened to be on the train last night when&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait! Stop a moment,&rdquo; Janet curtly interrupted, drawing
back. &ldquo;Step inside. I don&rsquo;t care to be seen talking
with you. Close the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Chick vouchsafed, with sinister intonation. &ldquo;That
hits me all right. It&rsquo;s just what I wanted. But none
would think less of you for talking with me, as far as
that goes&mdash;not much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There could be no mistaking such a beginning as this,
and the woman&rsquo;s white face lost much of its beauty under
the vicious scowl that settled upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to know,&rdquo; said Chick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Janet retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let it go at that, then. Take it for what it&rsquo;s worth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, you insolent&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, cut that!&rdquo; Chick interrupted, unruffled. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go
into the air because I&rsquo;m not handing you a pasteboard
with my monaker on it. I don&rsquo;t happen to have one. I
ain&rsquo;t a gink what carries his name pasted in his lid. My
name is Kennedy, plain Jim Kennedy, and I&rsquo;ve got a word
to say to you on a little matter of business. That&rsquo;s why
I&rsquo;m here, Miss Payson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chick coolly took a chair while speaking, the same
from which Murdock had just arisen. He noticed at once
that both wooden arms of the chair were slightly warm,
where the hands of some person had been recently resting
on them. Though he already knew that the woman
was not alone, having been watching her apartments since
early morning, he looked up at her and quickly added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken your chair, mebbe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied, pointing to one near her dressing
stand. &ldquo;I was sitting there. See here, Mr. Kennedy,
what&rsquo;s the meaning of this visit? Come to the point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had appeared in doubt up to that time, uncertain
what course to shape; but her voice and countenance
now denoted that she anticipated what was coming, that
she suspected the mission of her sinister visitor, and that
she also felt fully equal to meeting the situation. She
sat down quite abruptly and repeated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to the point. What do you want here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quickly told,&rdquo; Chick replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about the little
job that was pulled off last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What job, Mr. Kennedy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That train robbery. You know all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All about it!&rdquo; Janet exclaimed. &ldquo;What do you mean
by that? I know nothing about it&mdash;except that there was
a robbery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you do,&rdquo; Chick insisted. &ldquo;Nix on that. I happened
to be on the train, and I&rsquo;m wise to something that
no other gazabo noticed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; she coldly questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a gink with you in the car who didn&rsquo;t
show up after the robbery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He quit you just before the trick was turned, and he
didn&rsquo;t come back to you. He was no come-back kid,&rdquo;
Chick declared. &ldquo;He went through the smoker and uncoupled
it from the express car. He was the gink
who did the job, or one of the bunch&mdash;and you know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman heard him with hardly a change of countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very much mistaken,&rdquo; she said icily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My knowing anything about the robbery&mdash;or the man
you mention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was with you, wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sat with me, yes,&rdquo; Janet coldly admitted. &ldquo;But that
signifies nothing. There was no other vacant seat when
he entered the car, so he sat with me, and we entered
into conversation that did not end until he left me and
went into the smoker. That&rsquo;s all I know about him, all
I care about him. He was a total stranger to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chick grinned derisively and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, do I look as if I&rsquo;d swallow that?&rdquo; he asked, with
sinister contempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may swallow it, or not, as you like,&rdquo; Janet retorted,
with apparent indifference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might slip down the red lane of a country parson,
but not down mine,&rdquo; Chick went on. &ldquo;You see, Miss
Payson, I haven&rsquo;t knocked round Quakertown all my life
for nothing. I know all about you. I&rsquo;ve seen you round
town for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you have,&rdquo; sneered Janet. &ldquo;What of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of it, barring that I know all about you,&rdquo;
Chick informed her, more impressively. &ldquo;Your name is
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
Janet Payson, sometimes Jaunty Janet, and you live in
a ground-floor flat in Martin Street. That&rsquo;s what. You
see, I am onto your curves, and I&rsquo;m here to knock out
a homer. That&rsquo;s me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nix on the see-here gag!&rdquo; Chick interrupted. &ldquo;You
wait till I&rsquo;ve said my little verse. Then you can have
your spiel and go as far as you like. You ain&rsquo;t any main
dame in the social game. You&rsquo;re only the little casino
in a soiled deck. Your word wouldn&rsquo;t go in a Quaker
meetinghouse, say nothing of a criminal court. I know!
I&rsquo;m wise! You can&rsquo;t put nothing over on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what are you coming to?&rdquo; scowled Janet with
the rouge glaring more vividly on her pale cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. That&rsquo;s more like it,&rdquo; Chick went on,
with a sinister nod. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re getting down to brass
tacks. Pass up the grouch and let&rsquo;s talk business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; snapped Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what I want. There was a slick job pulled
off last night, and somebody has got sixty thousand bucks
in his jeans. I want a bit of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do!&rdquo; Janet sneered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take it out in wanting,
then, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe so, though I have a hunch that you&rsquo;ll change
your mind,&rdquo; Chick retorted. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t, it will be all
over but the settling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by settling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what I mean, all right. Mebbe, though, you
don&rsquo;t quite get me; I&rsquo;ll make it so plain that a blind
monkey could see it in the dark. I&rsquo;m out for the coin
myself, you know, when I see a chance to lift any. I&rsquo;d
be a bird if I let this chance slip by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean all I am saying,&rdquo; Chick cut in, with ominous
mien. &ldquo;Understand, though, I&rsquo;m not a gink who would
betray a pal. I wouldn&rsquo;t squeal on a friend if I was
strung toes up. Not on your tintype. But I&rsquo;m not a pal
of yours, nor of any of the bunch. I wasn&rsquo;t in this job,
I&rsquo;m only looking to get in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that you are here to blackmail me,&rdquo; snapped
Janet. &ldquo;Is that it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blackmail be hanged!&rdquo; growled Chick derisively. &ldquo;You
can&rsquo;t blackmail an ink spot. You know what I want&mdash;and
I&rsquo;m going to have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll know when you tell me,&rdquo; frowned the woman.
&ldquo;Not till then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chick jerked his chair nearer to that in which she
was seated. There was, indeed, no mistaking his meaning,
if one was to have judged from outward appearances.
His hangdog face wore an expression that none
could have misinterpreted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I mean, all right,&rdquo; he replied, with
more threatening intonation. &ldquo;I want a bit of that coin
and I&rsquo;m going to have it. When I get it, I&rsquo;ll go about
my business and keep my trap closed. I&rsquo;ll never squeal.
I&rsquo;ll never yip till the day of judgment. You can bank
on that, and bank on it good and strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And suppose you don&rsquo;t get it?&rdquo; questioned Janet, with
lowering gaze at him. &ldquo;What then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get yours, instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean, I take it, that you&rsquo;ll inform the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I mean,&rdquo; Chick nodded. &ldquo;Unless
some one comes across with the coin, it&rsquo;s you for the
caboose. I&rsquo;ll have a bull after you inside of half a minute.
I&rsquo;ll tell all I know about the job and all I know
about you. Your story wouldn&rsquo;t stand washing in distilled
water. The gink with the Vandyke whiskers did the job,
and you know it. I&rsquo;ll hand all this to the bulls, unless I
get mine, and I&rsquo;ll lose no time about it. That&rsquo;s all. It&rsquo;s
up to you, now. What d&rsquo;ye say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say that you may go to the devil, Kennedy, and do
your worst,&rdquo; snapped Janet, with eyes flashing. &ldquo;I say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop a moment! Stop a moment!&rdquo; cried Murdock,
stepping into the room. &ldquo;I reckon it&rsquo;s time for me to
have my say&mdash;or this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chick swung around in his chair and found himself
gazing&mdash;into the black muzzle of a leveled revolver.</p>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII.</span>
<br />A CHANGE OF BASE.</h2>
<p>Chick Carter did not appear much disturbed by the
threatening turn of the situation. He gazed at the weapon,
then at the man, without stirring from his chair.</p>
<p>Murdock had not replaced his disguise. His dark-featured
face wore a look as threatening as his weapon.
He added coldly, nevertheless, while Janet Payson shrank
back with a look of alarm:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep quiet, Janet, and let me settle this fellow.
I ought to let the gun do the talking, Kennedy, but I&rsquo;m
not going to. I only want to show you that I could turn
you down on the spot, if I was so inclined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chick recognized the man in spite of his changed appearance,
and he had known from the first that he was in
Janet&rsquo;s apartments. He pretended to be surprised, however,
and to have no idea that this was her companion
of the previous night on the train. He drew up in his
chair and replied, frowning darkly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have got the drop on me, all right, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t intend to take advantage of it,&rdquo; Murdock
interrupted, thrusting the weapon into his pocket. &ldquo;There
is a better way and a less risky one to settle this business.
I have heard all you said to this woman, Kennedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She told me she was alone,&rdquo; growled Chick, with an
ugly glance at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Murdock, taking a chair. &ldquo;You
took it for granted. I heard all she said. That&rsquo;s neither
here nor there, however. The question is, Kennedy, what
do you really intend doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard what I said,&rdquo; replied Chick, with a defiant
stare at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really mean it, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what. I&rsquo;m going to have my bit out of this
job, or there&rsquo;s going to be something doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will tell all you know, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about the size of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can be bought?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m here for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Murdock, with a nod. &ldquo;But why does
it devolve upon her to buy your silence? That&rsquo;s up to the
person who committed the crime. Assuming that you are
right, that the man you saw with her on the train had a
hand in the robbery, she certainly played no part in it. It&rsquo;s
hardly fair to ring her into it, or to ask her to buy your
silence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m out for the coin, and I&rsquo;m going to get it,&rdquo; Chick
grimly insisted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know the man, her companion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But it&rsquo;s enough that she knows him, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you identify him?&rdquo; Murdock interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I could. I saw him plain enough on the train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Murdock smiled a bit oddly, sure that Chick did not
suspect him of having been the crook. He took a cigar
from his pocket and lit it, remarking carelessly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bad egg, Kennedy, and you&rsquo;re serving this
woman a scurvy trick. No more could be expected of a
fellow of your cloth, I suppose, and I&rsquo;m not sure but
that would be the best way to settle with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it would!&rdquo; Chick quickly agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Jeff&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep quiet, Janet!&rdquo; Murdock commanded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
plain enough that Kennedy cannot be bullied. You&rsquo;re in
a mess, Janet, and I&rsquo;m going to pull you out. Nevertheless,
Kennedy, you must see that it&rsquo;s not up to this woman
to settle,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;She had no hand in the job, even
if your suspicions are correct. It&rsquo;s up to the man to buy
your silence. As a matter of fact, too, she has no money
with which to bribe you. Nor have I. You must see
the man himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trot him out, then,&rdquo; Chick said bluntly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the
very gink I want to see. I&rsquo;ll bring him to time, all right,
if I can get my lamps on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so easy to trot him out,&rdquo; Murdock replied.
&ldquo;He would have to trot a considerable distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean he ain&rsquo;t in town?&rdquo; questioned Chick, frowning
suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not within a dozen miles of Shelby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know where he is, then, I take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Murdock nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I not only know where he is, Kennedy, but I&rsquo;ll take
you to him,&rdquo; he said, after a moment. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the man
for you to see, and I have no doubt that you can make
some kind of a deal with him. He will conclude that&rsquo;s
the best way out of the difficulty, most likely, providing
your demands are not exorbitant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want the earth,&rdquo; Chick allowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to you, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To go with me and see him,&rdquo; said Murdock, in more
friendly fashion. &ldquo;I came in this morning to take Janet
out there. You may go with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a better way,&rdquo; Chick objected, grimly shaking
his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A better way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Let him come here and see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool, Kennedy,&rdquo; Murdock replied, with a
growl. &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t take chances of coming into town.
It would be all that his neck is worth to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it might be all that mine is worth to me, if I went
where he is,&rdquo; Chick dryly asserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might give it to me where the chicken got the
ax.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn you down? Is that what you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what,&rdquo; Chick nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not taking that
kind of a chance. Not for mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Murdock laughed and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take no chance at all, Kennedy, in going to see
him,&rdquo; he replied, in assuring tones. &ldquo;Neither he, nor any
of his gang, would risk running their necks into a rope
unless it was absolutely necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t, eh?&rdquo; queried Chick doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; Murdock insisted. &ldquo;And it wouldn&rsquo;t be
necessary in this case. With the big wad of money
acquired by the robbery, they&rsquo;ll be willing enough to settle
for any ordinary sum, rather than take the risk of putting
you away, even if so inclined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe so, after all,&rdquo; Chick demurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I already have shown you, besides, that I could have
turned you down on the spot, if I had wanted to,&rdquo; Murdock
added. &ldquo;But I wouldn&rsquo;t have a hand in that kind of
a job. You&rsquo;ll take no risk, Kennedy, in going to see the
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chick was not blind to the trap that was being laid
for him. He had expected no less, and had laid his
own plans accordingly. He still pretended to have some
misgivings, nevertheless, but asked, as if somewhat impressed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where must I go to see him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up Willow Creek way,&rdquo; said Murdock indefinitely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly a dozen miles from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a train?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can do better than take a train. None runs very
near the place, nor could you find it alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye mean by better?&rdquo; Chick demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the touring car that I came down in this morning,&rdquo;
said Murdock. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take Janet up there.
You can ride with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, is this on the level?&rdquo; asked Chick, frowning. &ldquo;If
not, I&rsquo;ll blow the head off of some one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Murdock laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean my head, of course,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll
have no cause to do so, Kennedy, on my word. I&rsquo;m giving
it to you dead straight, and you&rsquo;ll take no risk in going
with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That settles it,&rdquo; Chick declared abruptly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go.
Where is your car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the next street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, then, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Murdock interrupted. &ldquo;We must wait for
Janet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready, Jeff, all but my hat!&rdquo; she cried, rising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put it on, then, and we&rsquo;ll be off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chick waited, still with ominous and doubtful mien.</p>
<p>They left the hotel five minutes later, however, and
Murdock led the way to the waiting car.</p>
<p>Chick hesitated again when he saw the chauffeur and
another man in the conveyance, but Murdock said quickly,
in a confidential way:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only my chauffeur and one of the gang. You
might do worse, Kennedy, than to join us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would hit me all right,&rdquo; Chick said quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It could be arranged, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, then. I&rsquo;m with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Murdock introduced him to the two men&mdash;Dick Bryan
and Link Magee, both in disguise.</p>
<p>Chick recognized both, but did not betray it. He shook
hands with them, then took a seat in the tonneau, with
Bryan and Murdock on either side of him, Janet riding
in front, with the chauffeur.</p>
<p>Chick knew precisely what he was up against, and he
went against it willingly.</p>
<p>Murdock thought he knew, also, but the game was
deeper than he so much as suspected.</p>
<p>It was eleven o&rsquo;clock when the touring car sped out of
Shelby.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>A quarter hour later it passed through the miserable
settlement known as Benton Corners, the scene of previous
arrests by the Carters, and its course then lay north, as
Chick was expecting.</p>
<p>Others had passed that way since morning, however,
several others, and then were waiting miles beyond to
note the direction taken by this car at the only crossroad.
They had traveled through the woods, and were
waiting in the woods.</p>
<p>When Chick had ridden another mile, however, reaching
a desolate part of the wooded foothills, the expected
occurred. He felt Murdock suddenly seize his arm with
a viselike grip, and a revolver was thrust under his
nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Kennedy, you sit quiet,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You move
a finger and you&rsquo;ll get all that&rsquo;s coming to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; snarled Chick, shrinking. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean what I say, blast you!&rdquo; Murdock fiercely interrupted.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known you from the first. You are Chick
Carter, the detective, and we&rsquo;re going to land you with
your running mate. Get a rope on him, Bryan. Lend a
hand here, Link, and make him fast. I&rsquo;ll send a bullet
through him, if he shows fight, and that will end him. Be
quick about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rascals needed no second bidding, but their task
did not prove difficult.</p>
<p>For this was precisely what Chick had been expecting,
and he offered no resistance, though he met their threatening
remarks with predictions at which the ruffians only
laughed and sneered.</p>
<p>Half an hour later the car swerved out of the woodland
road and entered a clearing. It surrounded an isolated,
miserable old house, with a stable and numerous tumble-down
outbuildings, the home of two members of the bandit
gang, Solomon Mauler and his brother.</p>
<p>Chick Carter, then bound hand and foot, sized up the
miserable place&mdash;but appeared to have no interest in its
surroundings.</p>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX.</span>
<br />THE RESULT OF THE RUSE.</h2>
<p>It was in the miserable place, in part described, that
Nick Carter awoke to a realization that something unexpected
had befallen him. Returning consciousness brought
a sense of cramped limbs and bruised muscles, the results
of the blows he had received and the violence of his fall
from the moving train, when Sol Mauler rudely rolled
him from the express car.</p>
<p>The effect of all this was to leave Nick unconscious for
several hours, how many he hardly knew when he finally
revived.</p>
<p>He found himself lying on the floor of a stall in a
miserable stable, bound hand and foot in a way that
precluded liberating himself. He was sore, stiff, and
scarce able to stir, but he could use his eyes and ears,
and his brain soon became cleared of the cobwebs.</p>
<p>He could hear the movements of horses in the near
stalls. He could see the sunlight through chinks in the
walls of the old building. He knew that day had dawned,
if not already well spent, for the early songs of birds in
the trees through which he could hear the sweep of the
wind had ceased, and he reasoned that the morning was
far advanced.</p>
<p>All this was confirmed a little later, when the steps of
approaching men fell upon his ears, and the broad door
of the stable swung open on its rusty hinges. A blaze
of sunlight was shed into the dismal building.</p>
<p>Two men strode in and around to the stall in which
the detective was lying. They were Sol Mauler, who had
impersonated Cady, and his brother&mdash;Zeke Mauler. Why
they dwelt alone in that desolate region and how they
earned their living was a mystery to many, but there were
hints at moonshine whisky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon he&rsquo;s still in dreamland, Zeke,&rdquo; Sol Mauler was
saying, when they approached. &ldquo;He was hardly breathing
half an hour ago, when I fed the nags. Mebbe he&rsquo;ll croak
on our hands and save us the trouble of&mdash;no, blast him!
here he is with eyes wide open. His head&rsquo;s like a hickory
nut. So you&rsquo;re not going to croak without help, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last was added when the two ruffians appeared in
the entrance to the stall, both halting to glare down at
the prostrate detective.</p>
<p>Nick Carter gazed up at them, pale and bruised, but his
eyes had lost none of their confidence and severe
austerity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no fault of yours, Mauler, that I am still in the
land of the living,&rdquo; he sternly answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet it ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; growled Sol, with expressive nods.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have been done brown and planted deep, barring
a kick came from one we have to hear to. He ain&rsquo;t taking
chances of a rope. The coin is all he&rsquo;s out for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got it, too,&rdquo; put in Zeke, with a villainous leer.
&ldquo;We got it in spite of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make sure you hang onto it, then,&rdquo; Nick coldly advised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can bet your boots on that. We&rsquo;ll soon have it
planted where no infernal New York dick will find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so sure of it. You may slip a cog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No slips for us,&rdquo; said Sol confidently. &ldquo;You ought
to know that, Carter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not telling all I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did a fat job who brought you down here to
corral us fellows,&rdquo; Mauler went on derisively. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
too slick for any city guy of your cut. Why, I near
laughed in your ugly mug, when you boarded that express
car and shoved a letter from Burdick under my
nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then you started in to tell me who you was
and all about the job you were out to queer. Oh, my, but
that was rich!&rdquo; cried the ruffian, with a burst of coarse
laughter in which his low-browed brother joined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, very rich,&rdquo; Nick allowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then you pulled out a gun and wanted to know
was I game?&rdquo; cried the rascal, shaking with evil mirth.
&ldquo;You shoved the gun right in my hand and as much as
told me to hold you up. I did it all right, Carter, and we
got you&mdash;as we&rsquo;re going to get those two duffers who&rsquo;ve
been helping you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless they contrive to get you, you miscreant,&rdquo; Nick
retorted, frowning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you bank on that,&rdquo; cried Mauler, with a snort
and sneer. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have both of them by this time to-morrow.
We&rsquo;ll wipe you off the earth, all of you, and&mdash;by
thunder, Zeke, that must be Murdock already. Let&rsquo;s have
a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chugging of the laboring touring car, which was
at that moment entering the clearing, had fallen upon
the ears of all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Sol and Zeke Mauler rushed out of the stable, and uttered
a series of triumphant yells when they saw the laden
car and the powerless captive it contained.</p>
<p>It swept around the yard back of the house and stopped
nearly in front of the stable.</p>
<p>Jake Hanlon came running from the house at the same
moment, while Murdock leaped out of the car and cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, Sol. Your yelling would wake the
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll soon be dead uns here to wake, all right,&rdquo;
Sol shouted. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve got the other one, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that leaves only one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get him, too, a little later,&rdquo; snapped Murdock.
&ldquo;Lend a hand and bring him into the stable. We must get
rid of both before dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do that, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swing round, Bryan, and back in the car after they&rsquo;ve
got him out,&rdquo; Murdock continued to command. &ldquo;It might
be seen and known by chance. Get it under cover. I don&rsquo;t
want it suspected that I am in this business with you
fellows. That would queer us, for fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re booked to be queered, all right,&rdquo; thought Chick,
while three of the ruffians were hastening to lift him from
the car and bear him into the stable.</p>
<p>His anticipations were realized very much sooner, even
than he expected.</p>
<p>Of the six ruffians comprising the gang, five of them
were flocking into the small stable, three bearing the
bound form of the detective.</p>
<p>Only Bryan remained outside, and he fell to turning the
car, in which Janet Payson still was seated.</p>
<p>Not one among them had any apprehension of immediate
danger.</p>
<p>Other figures were approaching, however, those of half
a score of men, Patsy Garvan among them. They were
stealing as noiselessly as shadows from the woods and
shrubbery back of the stable, which they rapidly approached,
with ranks dividing to pass around both sides
of it.</p>
<p>Every man was armed with a rifle or a shotgun, save
Patsy Garvan, and he carried a revolver in each hand.</p>
<p>As now may be inferred, Chick Carter&rsquo;s ruse had been
to place himself in the hands of Janet Payson and the
man known to be her confederate, knowing that they
would take him to the headquarters of the gang, and in
the meantime to have Patsy so stationed with assistants
north of Benton Corners that the subsequent course of the
rascals could be stealthily followed.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, however, Patsy had seen the car
containing Murdock, Bryan, and Magee, two of whom he
recognized, when it went through Benton Corners on its
way to Shelby. The plans already laid with Chick told him
what would follow, beyond any reasonable doubt, and he
at once set about tracing the tracks of the touring car in
the direction from which it had come.</p>
<p>This, of course, brought him and his companions to the
Mauler place, less than ten minutes before Chick was
brought there, and all hands were concealed scarce thirty
feet back of the stable at that time.</p>
<p>The noise within had not abated when they came around
both front corners of the stable, half a score of constables
and officers from Shelby, but the voice of Patsy
Garvan then rang like a trumpet over other sounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, boys, get them!&rdquo; he shouted, leading the way.
&ldquo;Some of you look after that fellow in the car. We&rsquo;ve
got those in the stable cornered like rats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were yells of dismay from within before the
last was said, and a rush of five crooks toward the open
door.</p>
<p>Not a man among them ventured over its threshold
however, or so much as drew a weapon in self-defense.
The scene that met their gaze was enough to have daunted
any gang of desperadoes.</p>
<p>For they found themselves confronted with half a score
of leveled weapons, in the hands of as many determined
men, and not one among them but knew that an aggressive
move meant death.</p>
<p>It followed, therefore, that the arrest of the entire
gang was an easy task. All were in irons in less than
five minutes, and long before dark they occupied cells
in the Shelby County Jail.</p>
<p>The money stolen from the express car was found in
the cellar of the house, and later in the day was restored
to the railway company.</p>
<p>Upon returning to the Shelby House with Nick and
Patsy, all elated over their good work, Chick found a
telegram awaiting him from Lieutenant Lang.</p>
<p>It told him that Dan Cady, the missing express-car
man, had been found confined in Janet Payson&rsquo;s flat in
Philadelphia, in charge of another confederate, who had
been arrested.</p>
<p>It then appeared that Cady had been on friendly terms
with the woman and with Murdock, and that he had
carelessly confided the fact that he was to carry a costly
money package to Shelby on the night in question. This
led to Murdock&rsquo;s plot with his confederates, all having
been awaiting the opportunity to commit the car robbery
in the manner described, and Cady was lured to the flat
in the early part of the day and overcome, Sol Mauler
cleverly playing the part of his substitute.</p>
<p>This was rendered all the more feasible because of the
fact that Murdock was one of the old railway hands,
discharged for evil habits, and he was thoroughly familiar
with all of the details essential to such a plot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will teach Cady a lesson,&rdquo; Nick remarked to Chick
and Patsy that evening, as they sat smoking in their
suite in the hotel. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll select his companions more
carefully in the future. As for Murdock and the gang&mdash;well,
it now is up to them to pay the price.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is generally the easiest thing in the world to drive

so.</p>
<p>One afternoon he and his coach and four came rattling
up to the hotel like an avalanche. As the coach stopped,
one of the horses dropped dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a very sudden death,&rdquo; remarked a bystander</p>

<p>&ldquo;That sudden?&rdquo; coolly responded the driver; &ldquo;that &rsquo;os

<br />THE SECOND ACT.</h2>
<p>Klein went on with the business of his part, poking
at the property fire&mdash;a bunch of red globes buried in a
grate of coke. Other characters made their appearance,
and the dialogue opened briskly.</p>
<p>Miss Lindner, first to pick up the silver frame, frowned
as she delivered her lines. In an undertone, aside to
Klein, who was busily engaged in dusting an already spotless
piece of china, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to the property man, I&rsquo;ve got a new lover
to-day. Did you notice the change?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed&mdash;her back was to the audience&mdash;and as
Dodge, the character man, entered noisily, she made a
face at him. Dodge took his art seriously, and would not
&ldquo;clown&rdquo; on a scene. Others of the cast, aware of it,
&ldquo;kidded&rdquo; him at every possible opportunity.</p>
<p>When Dodge stood in front of the picture, addressing
it in thunderous rage&mdash;as the play demanded he should&mdash;Klein
watched him narrowly. Nothing happened, and
Klein decided mentally that the character man had not
noticed the difference between to-day&rsquo;s photograph and
the one used in the previous performances.</p>
<p>By this time Tanner was on the scene, and for possibly
ten minutes the dialogue and the action did not concern
the photograph. Then Miss Lindner made a hurried exit,
and Tanner began a soliloquy.</p>
<p>This was one of the longest speeches in the piece, and
the best, and Tanner delivered it with all the power and
passion he could command. At the finish, Klein, as the
butler, was supposed to enter and announce a visitor, who
happened to be Metcalfe.</p>
<p>Just before Klein&rsquo;s entrance Tanner strode across the
floor and picked up the frame. To this he was supposed
to deliver the final line, which at the same time supplied
the butler&rsquo;s cue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as for Lord Wellingmay,&rdquo; he dramatically recited,
&ldquo;let him beware. I am not the man to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped
so abruptly as to cause a titter to run through the audience,
who, up to this point had listened, spellbound.</p>
<p>Tanner had picked up the frame at this critical moment
and noticed the photograph.</p>
<p>Klein, waiting in the doorway for his cue, felt his pulse
quicken. The sight of the photograph&mdash;Delmar&rsquo;s photograph&mdash;had
caused Tanner to hesitate!</p>
<p>The wait grew longer. Fearful of the delay, and aware
that his entrance might set the dialogue moving once
more, Klein stepped through the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A visitor, Mr. Lemly!&rdquo; he announced stiffly.</p>
<p>Klein&rsquo;s line apparently brought Tanner back to earth
again, and with a peculiar frown he turned and took up
his cue.</p>
<p>While they were waiting for Metcalfe to enter, Klein
spoke aside to Tanner in the way that is quite common
on the stage, and which is often done, although the audience
has no idea how much private conversation goes on
among the actors during a play.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made you go up in the air?&rdquo; he asked&mdash;and
all the time a voice whispered in his ear: &ldquo;Tanner&rsquo;s
the man! Tanner&rsquo;s the man! His actions have proved it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tanner, meanwhile, was fumbling nervously at his collar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it&mdash;it was my nerves,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been pounding too hard on the next week&rsquo;s part. It&rsquo;s
frightfully warm here, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The entrance of Metcalfe interrupted the conversation.
The juvenile man dashed in and addressed his opening
line to Tanner. Klein withdrew to the background, where
he arranged the decanter and the glasses on a tray, preparatory
to the next piece of business.</p>
<p>The dialogue between the other men continued. Both
poured out their drinks. Metcalfe, posing dramatically
before the table, proposed a toast.</p>
<p>But the toast was never drunk. Hardly had the words
left Metcalfe&rsquo;s lips when he reeled slightly; the muscles
in his throat contracted violently. The glass slipped from
his fingers and crashed upon the surface of the polished
table.</p>
<p>A strange hush fell upon the scene, and in the silence
the steady hum of the calciums came like the droning
of a million bees.</p>
<p>It seemed an age must have elapsed before the strain
was broken, but in reality it could not have been more
than a few seconds. Yet in that time, swift as it was,
and unexpected, too, Klein had discovered the reason for
the interruption.</p>
<p>Metcalfe&rsquo;s eyes, at the moment of the toast, had fallen
upon Delmar&rsquo;s photograph. And the sight of it had
robbed him of all speech! He had betrayed even greater
agitation than had Tanner. What did it mean? What
could it mean, other than&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Like a snapping of a taut thread the tension was broken.
Metcalfe, as if suddenly aroused from a stupor, broke
into a hard and forced laugh, and he took up the regular
lines of the play.</p>
<p>Passing close to him, bearing the tray, Klein noticed
that the juvenile man&rsquo;s fingers were clenched and that
he was breathing a trifle faster than normal.</p>
<p>Klein was off the scene before the curtain of the act,
and was touching up his eyes when Metcalfe came into the
dressing room.</p>
<p>In a calm and matter-of-fact way Klein sought to
bring out the truth of the affair by referring to the incident
casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you trying to reconstruct the second act?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>Metcalfe sank down into his chair and removed his wig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you getting at?&rdquo; he asked curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that impromptu scene over the toast,&rdquo; Klein
explained. &ldquo;It was good as far as it went.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The juvenile man&rsquo;s hands were still trembling as he
squared himself in his chair preparatory to removing his
make-up. &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what&mdash;what came over me.
My nerves, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You looked as if you&rsquo;d seen a ghost,&rdquo; Klein ventured
to suggest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Metcalfe flashed him a quick glance, but Klein, bending
over his mirror, pretended not to notice it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I guess I did see a ghost,&rdquo; he wavered. &ldquo;Maybe
I am a fool, and all of that, but if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He hesitated,
daubing his cheeks. &ldquo;Klein,&rdquo; he began once more, as if
determined to relieve his mind of some weight, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
upset ever since I joined this company. There is something&mdash;something
I&rsquo;d like to talk over with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire away,&rdquo; Klein told him, treating the statement
with assumed indifference. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all ears. I suppose one
of your mash notes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is nothing like that, Klein,&rdquo; Metcalfe interrupted
gravely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious for once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, slowly unbuttoning his waistcoat. Klein
waited expectantly for him to continue, confident that
whatever was troubling the juvenile man would have a
direct bearing upon Delmar&rsquo;s photograph. That the photograph
had temporarily upset and confused Tanner was
not to be questioned. The excuse he had given Klein was
obviously a lie. Then, following this, had come Metcalfe&rsquo;s
dramatic scene, which beyond any doubt had been prompted
by the same photograph.</p>
<p>Yet both men avoided the real issue, and both attributed
their lack of self-control to a case of &ldquo;nerves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; Metcalfe said, &ldquo;on the very day
I left New York&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door of the dressing room was at this present
moment thrown open, and Dodge stepped inside. He
stood before the occupants with folded arms, glaring
from one to another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble, Dodge?&rdquo; Metcalfe asked, sinking
back in his chair, plainly annoyed at the interruption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matter? Matter?&rdquo; Dodge burst out indignantly. &ldquo;I
should think you gentlemen would be ashamed of yourselves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ashamed?&rdquo; echoed Klein. &ldquo;What have we&mdash;-&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to be stage manager of this company for about
five minutes,&rdquo; the character man interrupted. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what I would! Such outrageous actions as I witnessed
this afternoon would not be tolerated for an instant. You
gentlemen have absolutely no respect for your profession&mdash;none
at all. To clown on a scene deliberately is beneath
the dignity of a conscientious artist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s off,&rdquo; muttered Metcalfe; then louder: &ldquo;I suppose
when you were with Booth and Barrett&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was with Booth, young man,&rdquo; thundered Dodge,
his deep voice rolling impressively, &ldquo;we looked upon our
art as a most serious matter. In those palmy days, sir,
an actor held himself above such shameful proceedings
as clowning. Mr. Booth would no more have allowed it
than&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was playing the leads with &lsquo;Too Proud to
Beg,&rsquo;&rdquo; mocked the juvenile man, burlesquing the other,
&ldquo;in the palmy days of the melodrama, we were&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say no more,&rdquo; interrupted Dodge, lifting a hand.
&ldquo;It is not a thing to jest over. An artistic performance
should never be marred by impromptu speeches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Metcalfe puckered his lips and started to whistle. Dodge
glared at him for a second, then almost turned pale under
his make-up.</p>
<p>Metcalfe laughed. &ldquo;Still superstitious, Dodge? Well,
don&rsquo;t take it too hard. Let&rsquo;s see; to whistle in a dressing
room is a sign that the man nearest the door will be
whistled out of the company. Isn&rsquo;t that it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the character man stalked out, slamming the door
behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he took the hint,&rdquo; Klein said. &ldquo;To my mind,
he is the one bore in the company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The call boy&rsquo;s voice came echoing through the hall:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Third act! Third act!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Klein, who was on near the opening of the act, rose
to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me! I almost missed my entrance last night.
If I get in late this afternoon, Bond will fine me. I&rsquo;ll
talk with you later, Metcalfe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hurried out of the room and down the hall to the
stage.</p>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXI.</span>
<br />ENTER THE GIRL.</h2>
<p>The following night, Saturday, while the stage crew
were setting the second act, Klein strolled into the property
room for a &ldquo;side prop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my decanter?&rdquo; he asked of the property man,
Kingston.</p>
<p>The latter motioned toward a shelf. &ldquo;Up there. I&rsquo;ve
had a new batch of tea put in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Klein took the decanter and started with it toward the
door. At the same time he noticed Kingston placing a
new photograph in the silver frame used in the coming
act.</p>
<p>Aware of the actor&rsquo;s apparent interest, the property
man said, in a disgusted way: &ldquo;These fool temperamental
actors make me sick. Tanner told me I must
change the picture in this frame. I told him to go chase
himself, but when Metcalfe came along a few minutes
later and asked me to do the same thing&mdash;well, I thought
I&rsquo;d better give in and not take chances on makin&rsquo; trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with the photograph?&rdquo; Klein asked
casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I couldn&rsquo;t get at,&rdquo; Kingston returned.
&ldquo;The thing ain&rsquo;t seen by the audience. If it wasn&rsquo;t for
the director stickin&rsquo; to what he calls details, I could just
as well have stuck in a sheet of cardboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Klein reflected, watching the man insert a new photograph
and toss Delmar&rsquo;s into a drawer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Tanner or Metcalfe give any reason why they
wanted the change made?&rdquo; he asked presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nary a one,&rdquo; Kingston answered. &ldquo;Oh, I ain&rsquo;t been
around actors for ten years for nothin&rsquo;. You got to
treat &rsquo;em like a bunch of kids. If I didn&rsquo;t change this
picture, and one or the other of the fellows went up in
the air over it, Bond would lay me out. You see, I
ain&rsquo;t takin&rsquo; no chances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Klein went on the scene that night still puzzled. The
fact that both Tanner and Metcalfe had urged Kingston
to remove Delmar&rsquo;s photograph from the frame suggested
to Klein&rsquo;s mind several possibilities.</p>
<p>In attempting to deceive him, both men had placed
themselves in a bad light. It was plain to Klein that
the two men had been acquainted with Delmar, in one
way or another, and for certain reasons neither of them
desired the fact to become known.</p>
<p>Had not Dodge interrupted yesterday, Metcalfe might
have cleared up some of the mystery; but later, when
Klein broached the subject in a tactful manner&mdash;he did
not want to give the impression of being too interested&mdash;the
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
juvenile man seemed strangely perturbed, and did
not appear at all anxious to resume the story.</p>
<p>While Klein was disappointed, he was still far from
being discouraged&mdash;in fact, he had long ago dismissed the
latter word from his vocabulary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As Nick Carter would say,&rdquo; he murmured to himself,
as he took his position before the fireplace and waited
for the rising of the curtain: &ldquo;&lsquo;The trail is growing
warmer every minute.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the fall of the final curtain, a party of young
people who had witnessed the performance came back to
the stage. Metcalfe, who had been through the second
act, guided them around, answering volleys of questions.</p>
<p>To the ordinary person in the audience there is always
a certain amount of mystery and glamour connected with
the region on the other side of the footlights, and when
offered an opportunity to visit this kingdom of canvas and
tinsel little time is lost in accepting.</p>
<p>When Klein had finished dressing and was giving a final
tug at his cravat, the door of his room was flung open
and a bevy of giggling girls, led by Metcalfe, swarmed in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold Mr. Klein!&rdquo; cried the juvenile man, making an
exaggerated bow. &ldquo;Our lowly but none the less faithful
butler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Klein was introduced to all of the party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This comes near being a surprise party, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
he exclaimed. &ldquo;Oh, perhaps, you ladies are making a tour
of inspection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Lydecker has come to invite us all to her house,&rdquo;
said Metcalfe enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Klein bowed his personal acknowledgment. Miss Lydecker
seemed about the most attractive girl he had ever
seen.</p>
<p>On the way out of the theater Klein found himself
between Miss Lydecker and her friend, Miss Reed. The
latter was considerably the younger of the two girls, and
appeared to be at that age when the feminine heart is
likely to yearn for the glamour of the footlights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you made a splendid butler, Mr. Klein,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Really, I do. I told Helen so when you first came
out. Didn&rsquo;t I, Helen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen Lydecker nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it must be wonderful to be on the stage,&rdquo; Miss
Reed went on, gazing around at the bare walls, her eyes
shining. &ldquo;To think of devoting all the years of your life
to such a grand profession! Don&rsquo;t you just love it, Mr.
Klein?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find it interesting,&rdquo; Klein answered. Swiftly, like a
film upon a screen, he recalled the hours he had spent in
chilly offices waiting for engagements that never materialized;
recalled, too, the nerve-racking rehearsals, once
an engagement had been trapped, and the hundred side
parts he had learned in a few days, to say nothing of the
weary months of one-night stands. All of this he remembered,
but still smiled into the girl&rsquo;s eager face.</p>
<p>Later, when they had reached the stage door and were
climbing into several automobiles standing at the curb,
Miss Reed leaned close to Klein and whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just dying to be an actress. Don&rsquo;t you think you
could help me to get on the stage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid any assistance I might offer would be of
small benefit,&rdquo; Klein answered. &ldquo;Getting a start upon the
stage depends on the individual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the automobile Klein was separated from Miss Reed&mdash;a
condition of affairs that brought no regret&mdash;and found
Helen Lydecker a delightful substitute.</p>
<p>From her he learned that these Saturday-night dances
at her home were regular throughout the season, and that
the members of the Hudson Stock Company were always
honored guests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she hastened to explain, &ldquo;I discovered there
were no rehearsals on Sunday mornings, so that made it
possible for you of the company to remain up a little later
on Saturday nights. Oh, I have taken a great interest
in theatricals. Father, you know, owns the house in which
the company is playing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your friend, Miss Reed, is also interested in the profession,
isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; Klein returned. They both laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Reed imagines she has had a great sorrow in
her life,&rdquo; Miss Lydecker said. &ldquo;It was a love affair, of
course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so she turns to the stage for solace, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three big automobiles had deserted the city streets,
and were spinning swiftly along the hard dirt road. Suddenly
they swerved and began climbing a slope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our home is quite a distance from the town,&rdquo; Miss
Lydecker remarked, as the machines glided between high
iron gates and came to a stop before a big white house.
&ldquo;But it makes it all the more enjoyable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Klein helped her out of the motor car. The others,
laughing and chattering, hurried indoors. Miss Lydecker
motioned him to the far end of the long porch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; She stretched out a hand. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that wonderful?
I often sit here for hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Far below, in the soft, white moonlight, spread the
great Atlantic. The booming of the surf came faintly to
Klein&rsquo;s ears; the humid tang of salt air crept to his nostrils
and misted against his cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is wonderful,&rdquo; he murmured. Then, after a pause,
he added: &ldquo;This is my first real glimpse of the Atlantic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re from inland, then?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>He shook his head. &ldquo;No. California claims me. I
belong to that sect of egotists known as Native Sons.
We are not supposed to hear, feel, or see, once we have
stepped across our State line. Naturally, under these conditions,
I am of the opinion that there is no ocean except
the Pacific.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl smiled and tossed her head. &ldquo;Will you always
hold that opinion, Mr. Klein?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he reluctantly confessed. &ldquo;I&mdash;I believe
I am already weakening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From one end of the porch ran a narrow footbridge,
spanning the lower lawn and ending at a high cliff.
Miss Lydecker, noticing Klein&rsquo;s interest in this, hastened
to explain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy has built a summerhouse on the very edge of
that cliff. Would you care to go out? We call it Eagle&rsquo;s
Nest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They ventured out, the girl leading the way. Reaching
the cliff, the two stood for a minute in silence, gazing
down upon the sea. Only a narrow rail, breast-high, was
between them and a sheer drop of a hundred feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lean too far over the rail,&rdquo; the girl warned him,
half jesting. &ldquo;One of our men fell here a few years ago.&rdquo;
She shuddered. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t come near the Nest for
months afterward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, above the steady throb of the surf, there
came the first sounds of a distant orchestra.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Lydecker; &ldquo;the first dance!
And we&rsquo;re missing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They ran along the footbridge and across the broad
porch toward the big door. Just as they were about to
enter, Miss Lydecker stopped short, and a cry came from
her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; Klein asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right there!&rdquo; She pointed a finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man! I saw him slipping along&mdash;near those bushes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without another word Klein leaped from the porch
and gained the high hedge that ran parallel to the pebbled
roadway. He searched both sides for a dozen yards,
finally giving up the hunt and rejoining the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been a ghost,&rdquo; he told her laughingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly saw some one,&rdquo; she answered nervously.
Then her brow cleared. &ldquo;How foolish of me! Let&rsquo;s not
waste any more time. The first dance will be over before
we get on the floor.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXII.</span>
<br />A NEW MYSTERY.</h2>
<p>After several dances in the big room cleared for that
purpose, the guests were invited to an adjoining room,
where supper was served by the hostess and her mother.
Tanner, Metcalfe, and other members of the stock company
were hovering about Miss Lydecker, drinking impromptu
toasts, laughing, and exchanging pleasantries.</p>
<p>She finally broke away from them and came over to
where Klein was chatting with Miss Reed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just telling Miss Reed,&rdquo; Klein said, &ldquo;how careless
the majority of you girls are with your jewels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose for one minute, Mr. Klein, that
we would keep them locked up when so many gallant
men are about!&rdquo; Miss Lydecker exclaimed. She fumbled
at a big brooch pinned on her bodice. It was a wonderful
piece of workmanship, fashioned of diamonds and other
precious stones, and cunningly wrought in the shape of a
lotus flower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy gave me this last week, and told me never to
wear it except on state occasions,&rdquo; Miss Lydecker announced.
&ldquo;It has been in our family several generations,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Metcalfe interrupted at this moment. &ldquo;Playing favorites
so early in the evening, Miss Lydecker?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been given a warning,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Black-hand letter?&rdquo; asked Tanner, who had strolled
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly as bad as that. But as usual it fell upon deaf
ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several other men came up at this moment, and the
conversation was abruptly shifted. Klein watched as Miss
Lydecker walked away, surrounded by a group of admirers.</p>
<p>Perhaps five minutes elapsed. None of the guests had
left the room&mdash;of this Klein was positive, since he was
sitting nearest the door&mdash;and the incessant chatter rose
and fell like the murmur of surf on a distant shore.</p>
<p>The men were allowed to enjoy cigars, and the room
was soon filled with drifting smoke. Tanner, evidently
at some one&rsquo;s request, stepped to the nearest window and
opened it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better.&rdquo; He drew in a
deep breath. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the sea air refreshing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat down on the arm of Klein&rsquo;s chair. &ldquo;Do you
know it is three o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d forgotten about the time,&rdquo; Klein answered. &ldquo;I
suppose we ought to be home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dress rehearsal to-morrow night, remember,&rdquo; Tanner
cautioned. &ldquo;Bond raked me over the coals to-day. I&rsquo;ve
got sixty sides for next week, and I&rsquo;ve hardly glanced
at the script. It is up to me to pound all day to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Lydecker came over and joined them. &ldquo;The party
is breaking up. I&rsquo;ll have the cars sent around,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s thoughtful of you, Miss Lydecker,&rdquo; replied
Tanner. &ldquo;What a hostess you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not forget next Saturday night,&rdquo; she cautioned
both of the men. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have a real
party. It&rsquo;s my birthday. Daddy has promised me an
orchestra from New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could not keep us away,&rdquo; murmured Tanner.</p>
<p>Klein, who had been watching her closely, suddenly
spoke. &ldquo;I notice, after all, Miss Lydecker, that you have
taken heed of my warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What warning?&rdquo; she asked, frowning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the brooch. You have put it away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s hand went quickly to her collar, and instantly
she paled. &ldquo;The&mdash;the brooch,&rdquo; she gasped; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s&mdash;gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t take it off yourself?&rdquo; cried Klein.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she faltered; &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;it&rsquo;s lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; broke from Tanner&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t been out of this room since you spoke
with me last, have you?&rdquo; inquired Klein.</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it must be in here&mdash;some place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tanner gripped Klein&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;Do you think some one
might&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to find that out,&rdquo; said Klein. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
sitting here for the past half hour. Not one of the guests
passed out; I&rsquo;m positive of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tanner&rsquo;s eyes narrowed as he caught Klein&rsquo;s meaning.
&ldquo;I understand. We&rsquo;ll keep them all here until&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later the whole room was made aware
of the discovery. The girls huddled together in a frightened
group, while the men gathered around Tanner and
Klein.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw the brooch barely fifteen minutes ago,&rdquo; Klein
said, addressing them. &ldquo;And Miss Lydecker has not been
out of this room. The brooch must be in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under his direction the room was gone over, inch by
inch. Nothing was found. After that, at Tanner&rsquo;s suggestion,
each of the men submitted himself to a search.
Tanner allowed Klein to search him, and then the process
was reversed. Following this, Klein assured himself that
none of the other men present had the jewel upon him.</p>
<p>Klein walked over to Miss Lydecker and spoke to her.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give up so readily, Miss Lydecker. Your brooch
cannot be far away. Every man here, I am sure, will
make a determined effort to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what&rsquo;ll daddy say?&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;He told me
not to wear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up!&rdquo; exclaimed Klein. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager you&rsquo;ll be
wearing it before next Saturday night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Lydecker finally calmed herself, and offered a limp
hand to the departing guests. The machines drew up at
the door, and the girls and their escorts silently took their
seats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry too much,&rdquo; Klein said, smiling into her
white face; &ldquo;things may brighten to-morrow. Good-by.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIII.</span>
<br />THE ARDENT SLEUTH.</h2>
<p>Irving Hamilton Tod, man of means and colt reporter
for the New York <i>Morning News</i>, realized, after his
painful interview with the warden at the Newport jail,
that for the second time in almost as many days he had
been outwitted.</p>
<p>The warden at the jail had never heard of a detective
by the name of Jarge. Where, then, had this black-eyed
sleuth disappeared to, and what had been his object in
lying? Had he taken Klein back to New York?</p>
<p>With a dozen other questions hammering at his brain,
Tod walked slowly back to the hotel. Passing the telegraph
office recalled to his mind the hopeful message he
had sent to Reed, the city editor. It was like salt to an
open wound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reed will hand me another laugh,&rdquo; he muttered dismally.
&ldquo;Fate&rsquo;s against me, sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dragged himself through the hotel lobby; then,
catching sight of a swinging door and hearing the tinkle
of glasses, he determined to do a very unusual thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a good, stiff drink before I eat,&rdquo; he said to
himself, with an air of martyrdom.</p>
<p>He pushed his way into the bar and gulped down a
high ball. His lagging and depressed spirits seemed started
on the upward climb. He encouraged them by repeating
his order. Just as he finished tipping up the second glass
a hand fell upon his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he said, whirling, &ldquo;who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A flushed and grinning face was lifted to his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember you,&rdquo; the intruder stated very clearly,
blinking his eyes. &ldquo;Your friends left you at the dock
last night, didn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; exclaimed Tod, as the truth dawned upon
him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the cabby who&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped, and his
heart began to pound swiftly. What luck this was!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you drinking?&rdquo; he asked, motioning to the
alert barkeeper.</p>
<p>When the drinks were before them, Tod resumed his
talk. &ldquo;Where did you take my friends last night, cabby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cabby grinned, tossed off his drink, and wiped his
lips with the back of his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take &rsquo;em? Well, at first they wanted the police station&mdash;then
they wanted the railroad station. So I took
&rsquo;em there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the railroad station?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just that. I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; it was funny&mdash;but it ain&rsquo;t my
place to ask questions. Just so long as I gets my fare,
what&rsquo;s the odds!&rdquo; He paused and bestowed a longing
glance upon the bottle in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fill it up again,&rdquo; Tod said quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, I&rsquo;ll just do that.&rdquo; The glass was filled and
pressed to his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you notice what train my friends took?&rdquo; Tod inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t both take the same train,&rdquo; was the unexpected
answer. &ldquo;I&mdash;I was hangin&rsquo; around waitin&rsquo; for
a fare, so I watched.&rdquo; The cabby chuckled to himself.
&ldquo;No, sir, they didn&rsquo;t! One of &rsquo;em takes the four o&rsquo;clock
for Fall River and the other gets on the express for
Boston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; burst from Tod. Then, after an effort
to control his voice, he asked: &ldquo;Which one took the
express for Boston?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cabby&rsquo;s head was rolling unsteadily from side to
side. &ldquo;Which&mdash;which one? Now jus&rsquo; let me see.&rdquo; He
weighed the question for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the men wore a badge. You saw it, didn&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; broke from the expectant Tod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I saw it,&rdquo; returned the cabby, wagging a forefinger
in the air. &ldquo;And he&mdash;and he was the fellow what
took the&mdash;the Fall River train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man with the badge took the Fall River train?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the other man went to Boston?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This final announcement sent Tod&rsquo;s heart galloping.
His wide, blue eyes, once so clouded, brightened like an
April sky after a shower. &ldquo;Thanks! Have a couple more
on me!&rdquo; he said, tossed a bill on the bar, and darted out
through the swinging doors into the lobby.</p>
<p>In another minute he had paid his bill at the desk and
was hurrying down the street toward the railroad station.
The clerk had informed him that a train left for Boston
in five minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything isn&rsquo;t lost, after all,&rdquo; he told himself exultantly.
&ldquo;What a fool I was to be discouraged so soon!
Klein&rsquo;s in Boston, and I&rsquo;ll get him before the week is out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so enthusiastic did he become over the glowing
prospects ahead of him, that he completely forgot that he
had neither bathed nor shaved nor had his breakfast.</p>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIV.</span>
<br />MR. AMOS JARGE.</h2>
<p>Two days previous to the mysterious robbery at the
Lydecker home a slim, black-eyed stranger, alighting from
the local train at Hudson, inquired of the cabman who
drove him up to the business section the location of a
certain real-estate firm.</p>
<p>As the result of his visit there the stranger engaged
an office in the most prominent business building in the
town, and upon the glass door, so that all who passed
might read, was lettered:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Amos Jarge.
<br />Private Detective Agency.</span></p>
</div>
<p>On the Monday following the robbery the portly form
of Mr. Lydecker might have been seen entering the elevator
of the same building. And directly behind him,
also entering the elevator, came hurrying another man.
Apparently preoccupied, this latter stepped upon Mr. Lydecker&rsquo;s
heels. Instantly he drew back with profuse apologies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand pardons, sir! I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off
abruptly and held out his hand. &ldquo;Why, Mr. Lydecker!
This is, indeed, a surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lydecker&rsquo;s brow cleared and he accepted the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul! What are you doing in Hudson, Mr.
Jarge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jarge laughed. &ldquo;I had quite forgotten that you lived
in this city,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Let me see, the last time we
met was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the Fall River boat,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Lydecker.
&ldquo;I can never forget that incident! You returned my
daughter&rsquo;s jewels to me; don&rsquo;t you remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so.&rdquo; Jarge nodded slowly. &ldquo;Of course, of course!
That was during the time of my employment with the
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
Fall River Company. Since you have recalled it, I remember
the incident perfectly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had stepped out of the elevator now and were
standing in the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are no longer in the services of the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
Mr. Lydecker began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I resigned a month ago,&rdquo; Jarge interrupted. &ldquo;I have
since started in business for myself. I have opened a
chain of offices between Boston and New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Lydecker. &ldquo;And where&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Straight ahead of you, sir.&rdquo; Jarge waved indifferently
toward a door at the end of the hall. &ldquo;That is my headquarters
for Hudson and the surrounding district.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lydecker followed the hand, and read the black
letters on the glass door of the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;this is pleasing news. I
sincerely trust you will find success in your new venture,
Mr. Jarge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. I believe I have made a good beginning.&rdquo;
He paused reflectively, as if his thoughts were a thousand
miles away. &ldquo;And now, if you will pardon me, Mr.
Lydecker,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;I will be hurrying back to my
desk. There are so many details to arrange and so
much&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, certainly,&rdquo; broke in the other. &ldquo;I understand,
of course. And&mdash;and possibly, later on, I might
have a little work for you myself, Mr. Jarge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The detective nodded in a disinterested manner. &ldquo;I
shall be pleased to handle it. Good day, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jarge swung briskly away, and Mr. Lydecker watched
as the door closed behind him. Then he walked down
the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very smart and intelligent man, this Jarge,&rdquo; he
told himself. &ldquo;I think I will make no mistake in hiring
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day Mr. Lydecker called at Jarge&rsquo;s office, only
to be met by a curt and busy stenographer with the announcement
that the detective was out on an important
case, and would not return before the next day.</p>
<p>On the following afternoon Mr. Lydecker was again
unfortunate, and learned from the same busy and curt
stenographer that Mr. Jarge was still engaged and was
not expected in the office until Friday at the very earliest.</p>
<p>So, on Friday, Mr. Lydecker called up Jarge on the
telephone and asked for an appointment.</p>
<p>The detective happened to be in his office at the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I will have to disappoint you, Mr. Lydecker,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pressed with other business.
Wouldn&rsquo;t some day next week answer just as well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must see you to-day,&rdquo; insisted the other. &ldquo;It is a very
important matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps one of my assistants can be of service to you,&rdquo;
Jarge went on to say. &ldquo;I can arrange to have&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lydecker demurred at once. &ldquo;I must take this up
with you personally, Mr. Jarge. I am willing to pay
extra for the favor. But it must be arranged before
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see just how&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Jarge began, only to be
interrupted by:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see you for five minutes. I can explain my
case and you can judge for yourself. You can surely
grant me that much time, Mr. Jarge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The detective hesitated, then cleared his throat. &ldquo;Very
well, Mr. Lydecker,&rdquo; he answered reluctantly. &ldquo;I can
allow you five minutes. I will be in the office at eleven
o&rsquo;clock sharp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much, Mr. Jarge. I shall be there on
the hour. If you only knew how&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the detective had already hung up his receiver. So
the perturbed Mr. Lydecker was forced to do the same.</p>
<p>Promptly at eleven o&rsquo;clock Mr. Lydecker stepped nervously
out of the elevator on the sixth floor of the business
block, and, walking to the far end of the hall, entered
the office of Mr. Amos Jarge, private detective.</p>
<p class="tbcenter"><span class="smaller">TO BE CONTINUED.</span></p>
<h2><span class="small">CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.</span></h2>
<p>The jury had retired for consultation prior to bringing
in a verdict of &ldquo;Guilty,&rdquo; which was expected of them.
Retiring at all seemed little more than a farce, for from
the beginning to the end of the case the evidence had
gone so steadily against the defendant that by the time
the last witness had been called there was no manner
of doubt in the public mind that Robert Sullivan had deliberately
and in cold blood murdered Jack Wilder, and
it needed not the vigorous speech of the prosecuting attorney
to convince any one to that effect.</p>
<p>The evidence, being briefly summed up, ran as follows:
Robert, or, as he was more familiarly called, Bob Sullivan,
while in a state of intoxication, quarreled with and
lost his last cent to Jack Wilder, a professional sharper.
Awaking the morning after his debauch, to find himself
beggared, he had sworn, in the presence of several witnesses,
to get his money back or kill the man who
had outwitted him. Accordingly, he had set out to meet
Wilder on his return from a neighboring town, and next
day the body of the latter was found in a lonely stretch
of the road, with a knife sticking in his heart.</p>
<p>Sullivan had been obliged to admit that he had met his
enemy near this spot, and that they had a stormy interview,
but maintained that they parted without blows, as
Wilder promised him to restore his money. There was no
tittle of circumstantial evidence wanting to confirm the
appearance of Sullivan&rsquo;s guilt, and even the attorney for
the defense was privately convinced of the falsity and absurdity
of his client&rsquo;s plea of &ldquo;Not guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The judge, a large, pompous man, having instructed
the jury in his most severe and autocratic manner, busied
himself with some papers, and did not deign a glance
to the assemblage below. It was, as could readily be
observed, a gathering of small tradespeople and farmers.
Here and there the keen face of a lawyer or that of a
stranger from the neighboring city stood out boldly
from the sea of honest vacuity which surrounded it.</p>
<p>The prisoner sat with his face buried in his hands,
which had lost their former tan, and were pale and
trembling. Near him was his wife, hugging a sickly
babe to her breast, and showing in her wild eyes, twitching
mouth, and every line of her meager, stooping figure,
the terror which held her in its grasp. A breathless
silence was upon that audience in the shabby courtroom;
even the baby had ceased its fretful wailing, and the buzz
of a bluebottle fly entangled in a spider&rsquo;s web in the window
was the only sound that broke the stillness.</p>
<p>Five minutes passed, ten, twenty, and still the jury
had not come. A murmur of impatience began to be
heard, and presently the judge beckoned the sheriff to him,
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
whispered a few words in his ear, and saw him depart
through the same door which apparently swallowed up
the jurors. The sheriff made his way through several
gloomy passages into a large, light room, where he inquired
of the foreman if they were not yet agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo; gruffly responded that functionary.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s eleven of us for hangin&rsquo;, but Conway, there,
won&rsquo;t hear to it. He wants to clear the feller out an&rsquo;
out, an&rsquo; says he&rsquo;ll stay with us till kingdom come before
he&rsquo;ll budge an inch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giles Conway, the man whose obstinacy was causing such
unnecessary delay, was seated rather apart from the
rest, and wore the brown jeans and soft hat which marked
him a farmer. Even had not the absence of any attempt
at foppishness proclaimed his caste, there was something
about him which insensibly connected itself in the observer&rsquo;s
mind with the free winds and untrammeled sunshine
of the country. He was much the same color from
his head to his feet, for eyes, skin, hair, and beard were
alike brown, and only the deep lines on his firm, squarely
cut face showed that he was no longer young. Just at
present he seemed in no wise disconcerted by the wrathful
impatience of his associates, but pushing his felt hat
farther back on his head, and settling himself more comfortably
in his wooden chair, said slowly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, friends, you won&rsquo;t ever get me to hand over a
man to the gallows on such evidence as that, an&rsquo; there
ain&rsquo;t no special use of cussin&rsquo; about it, for it won&rsquo;t do a
bit of good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but that is such foolishness!&rdquo; broke in one of the
group. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s all this evidence, that no man in his
senses could doubt, a-goin&rsquo; to prove that Bob Sullivan
killed Jack Wilder, and here you sit like a bump on a log,
and won&rsquo;t listen to none of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; replied Conway. &ldquo;You all think that
evidence like that orter hang a man, but if you&rsquo;d seen
as much of that sort of thing as I have, you&rsquo;d think different.
I ain&rsquo;t much of a talker, but maybe you wouldn&rsquo;t
mind listenin&rsquo; to a case of this kind I happen to know
about, an&rsquo; maybe the time I&rsquo;m done&mdash;an&rsquo; it won&rsquo;t take me
long to tell it&mdash;you&rsquo;ll see why I don&rsquo;t want to hang a
young fellow I&rsquo;ve known nearly all my life for somethin&rsquo;
that very likely he didn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You all know how when I wasn&rsquo;t much over twenty
I went West an&rsquo; put all the money I could rake an&rsquo; scrape
into a ranch an&rsquo; cattle. Well, the place next to mine
was owned by a young fellow&mdash;we&rsquo;ll call him Jim Saunders,
although that isn&rsquo;t his name&mdash;who&rsquo;d come out, like
me, to make his fortune. We took to each other from
the first, an&rsquo; pretty soon we were more like brothers
than a good many of the real article I&rsquo;ve seen since.
After a while Jim told me he was goin&rsquo; to get married,
an&rsquo; a few weeks later he brought home the prettiest little
thing you&rsquo;d see in a day&rsquo;s ride. She had lots of yellow
hair that was always tumblin&rsquo; down over her shoulders,
an&rsquo; big blue eyes, an&rsquo; a voice like a wild bird, an&rsquo; Jim&mdash;well,
he thought there wasn&rsquo;t nobody like Milly in all
the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She seemed fond of him, too, at first, but it wasn&rsquo;t
long before I could see that it was a clear case of misfit
all round. There was lots of excuse for her, for of
course it was a hard life, an&rsquo; she loved finery an&rsquo; pretty
things, an&rsquo; Jim didn&rsquo;t have the money to give &rsquo;em to
her, though he worked early an&rsquo; late, an&rsquo; did his level
best to make somethin&rsquo; more than a livin&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it would have turned out all right in time if
it hadn&rsquo;t been that one day Jim went to the nearest town
to buy some farmin&rsquo; implements, an&rsquo; fell in there with
a fellow he used to know back East, and nothin&rsquo; would
do him but he must go home with Jim to see how he
was fixed. Well, he come, an&rsquo; it was a black day for
Jim when he set foot on his threshold, for from the
minute he saw Milly he hadn&rsquo;t eyes for nothin&rsquo; else, and
she bein&rsquo; a woman, was mightily set up to think a city
man would set such store by her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He made himself so pleasant an&rsquo; so much at home
that they begged him to stay all night, an&rsquo; long about
twelve o&rsquo;clock he was, or pretended to be, took awful
sick. They worked with him till he got better, and
wouldn&rsquo;t hear of his tryin&rsquo; to go away next mornin&rsquo;; so
he stayed on, setting on the big rockin&rsquo;-chair with a
pillow behind him an&rsquo; talkin&rsquo; to Milly while Jim was off
at work. He didn&rsquo;t seem in no particular hurry about
goin&rsquo;, but Jim never &rsquo;spicioned for a minute that anything
was wrong, for he liked the fellow first-rate, an&rsquo; would
no more have thought of doubtin&rsquo; Milly than he would
the Lord that made him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One evenin&rsquo; he came in late, tired an&rsquo; hungry, an&rsquo;
foun&rsquo; that his wife&mdash;his wife that he loved&mdash;had left him
and gone away with that devil that he thought was
his friend! He went wild for a while. It seemed to
him like everything was black around him, an&rsquo; there was
great splotches of blood before his eyes, an&rsquo; he could
hear voices that kept a-laughin&rsquo; at him an&rsquo; callin&rsquo; him a
fool, an&rsquo; the only thing he held fast to was that he
must follow &rsquo;em to the world&rsquo;s end and kill the man
that had took away all he had. So he tracked &rsquo;em, now
here, now there, but always they doubled on him, till at
las&rsquo;, when his money was gone, he lost &rsquo;em altogether.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he came to himself a little, an&rsquo; sold his ranch
an&rsquo; went back to his old home to wait&mdash;for he knowed
somehow that one day, sooner or later, the Lord would
give him his revenge. He worked while he waited, an&rsquo;
made money an&rsquo; got well off, an&rsquo; nobody knew nothin&rsquo;
&rsquo;bout his ever bein&rsquo; married, so he had somethin&rsquo; like
peace. But he never forgot, an&rsquo;, after a while, it seemed
like he didn&rsquo;t feel so hard toward Milly, for he remembered
how young she was, an&rsquo; how foolish, an&rsquo; what a
devil she had to deal with; an&rsquo; sometimes he could see
her with the pretty color all gone from her cheeks, an&rsquo;
the laugh from her voice, heartbroken an&rsquo; deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last, twenty years afterward, when he was gettin&rsquo;
on in life, his time came. He was ridin&rsquo; along, not
thinkin&rsquo; about anything in particular, when he happened
to look up, an&rsquo; there, comin&rsquo; toward him roun&rsquo; a bend
in the road, an&rsquo; ridin&rsquo; on a big black horse, was the man
he&rsquo;d waited for all these years. They knowed each
other the minute their eyes met, an&rsquo; the fellow got white
as chalk an&rsquo; pulled his horse clean back on his haunches,
tryin&rsquo; to turn roun&rsquo; an&rsquo; make a run for it, but it wasn&rsquo;t
no good, for Jim was off his horse in a minute an&rsquo; had
him by the throat, an&rsquo; in less time than it takes to tell
it, he had pulled him down, cursin&rsquo; an&rsquo; cuttin&rsquo; at him, to
the ground. Then, holdin&rsquo; him there, with his knee on
his breast an&rsquo; his knife at his throat, he says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s Milly? Tell me, or I&rsquo;ll cut your devilish
heart out!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fellow glared back at him like a rat in a trap,
an&rsquo; seein&rsquo; death in his eyes, an&rsquo; knowing &rsquo;twas no use to
lie, says:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;She&rsquo;s dead; she got sick when we got to New York,
an&rsquo; I left her, an&rsquo; she died in a week.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;d orter kill you like a snake, but I&rsquo;ve always lived
square, an&rsquo; the Lord helpin&rsquo; me, I&rsquo;ll die that way, so
I&rsquo;ll give you an even chance. Get out your knife an&rsquo;
fight, an&rsquo; remember that one of us has got to die right
here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he let him up, and they went at it. They was
pretty evenly matched to look at &rsquo;em, but Jim thought
of Milly dyin&rsquo; all alone, an&rsquo; fought like a tiger, an&rsquo; pretty
soon he left the man that had come between &rsquo;em stiff
an&rsquo; stark with a knife in his heart, an&rsquo; his white face
a-glarin&rsquo; up at the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then comes in the part of the story that I want you
all to take for a warnin&rsquo;, before you&rsquo;ll be so quick to find
any man guilty on nothin&rsquo; but circumstantial evidence.
When the body was found, nobody ever thought of
&rsquo;spicionin&rsquo; Jim, but everything pointed to another man
as the one who had done the killin&rsquo;. He&rsquo;d sworn to kill
the dead man; he was on the hunt for him when last
seen, an&rsquo; he couldn&rsquo;t prove no alibi. So they arrested
him, and the first Jim heard of it he was summonsed
on the jury that was to try him. Jim hadn&rsquo;t never
thought of giving himself up for a murder, for he
knowed he&rsquo;d fought and killed his enemy fair an&rsquo;
square, an&rsquo; he was glad he done it. He didn&rsquo;t see that
it was any business of the law&rsquo;s to interfere between
&rsquo;em, and he didn&rsquo;t like to drag in Milly&rsquo;s name before
the judge an&rsquo; jury an&rsquo; all the people who wouldn&rsquo;t remember,
like he did, when he was young an&rsquo; innocent.
Even when he was summonsed, he didn&rsquo;t have
any notion but he would be cleared when they&rsquo;d look
into things some, an&rsquo; he made up his mind not to say
nothin&rsquo; if he could help it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when he got there, everything went so dead against
the prisoner that if he hadn&rsquo;t knowed he&rsquo;d done the killin&rsquo;
himself, he&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; thought sure he was guilty. He got
kind of dazed at last, and didn&rsquo;t seem to know nothin&rsquo;
till he found himself in a room with the rest of the
jury, an&rsquo; all eleven of &rsquo;em wanting to hang the man that
he knowed was innocent. Then he came to his senses
and voted against &rsquo;em, an&rsquo; when they asked him for his
reasons, he told &rsquo;em the story I&rsquo;ve been tellin&rsquo; you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giles Conway stopped and gazed stolidly into the eyes
of his audience, who had gathered around him till they
hemmed him in on every side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; what did they do with him?&rdquo; asked the foreman
at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered slowly. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t decided
yet, for Jack Wilder was the man that run off with Milly,
an&rsquo; it was me that killed him.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>NOT TO BE OUTDONE IN POLITENESS.</h3>
<p>A rich old man lying on his deathbed had assembled his
three nephews to acquaint them with the manner in which
he intended to dispose of his property.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To you, my dear John, as you have always been a
steady and dutiful nephew, I have left the sum of twenty
thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my dear uncle,&rdquo; said John, burying his
face in his pocket handkerchief to conceal his emotion. &ldquo;I
only hope you may live to enjoy it yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, also, Thomas, have been a good lad. I have, therefore,
left you the sum of fifteen thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my dear uncle. I only hope you may live
to enjoy it yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for you, Frank, you have been a sad dog; to you,
therefore, I have left the sum of twenty-five cents to buy
a rope to hang yourself with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my dear uncle,&rdquo; said the dutiful nephew.
&ldquo;I only hope you may live to enjoy it yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><span class="small">THE NEW WEATHER SYSTEM.</span></h2>
<p class="center">By MAX ADELER.</p>
<p>Cooley is the inventor of an improved system of foretelling
the weather. He has a lot of barometers, hygrometers,
and such things, in his house, and he claims that by
reading these intelligently, and watching the clouds in
accordance with his theory, a man can prophesy what kind
of weather there will be three days ahead. They were getting
up a Sunday-school picnic in town in May, and as
Cooley ascertained that there would be no rain on a certain
Thursday, they selected that day for the purpose.
The sky looked gloomy when they started, but as Cooley
declared that it absolutely couldn&rsquo;t rain on Thursday,
everybody felt that it was safe to go. About two hours
after the party reached the grounds, however, a shower
came up, and it rained so hard that it ruined all the provisions,
wet everybody to the skin, and washed all the cake
to dough. Besides, Peter Marks was struck by lightning.
On the following Monday the agricultural exhibition was
to be held, but as Mr. Cooley foresaw that there would be
a terrible northeast storm on that day, he suggested to
the president of the society that it had better be postponed.
So they put it off, and that was the only clear
Monday we had during May. About the first of June, Mr.
Cooley announced that there would not be any rain until
the fifteenth, and consequently we had showers every day,
right straight along up to that time, with the exception of
the tenth day, when there was a slight spit of snow. So
on the fifteenth, Cooley foresaw that the rest of the month
would be wet, and by an odd coincidence, a drought set
in, and it only rained once during the two weeks, and that
was on the day which Cooley informed the baseball club
that it could play a match, because it would be clear.</p>
<p>On toward the first of July, he began to have some
doubts if his improved weather system were correct; he
was convinced that it must work by contraries; so when
Professor Jones asked him if it would be safe to attempt
to have a display of fireworks on the night of the fifth,
Cooley brought the improved system into play, and discovered
that it promised rainy weather on that night.
So then he was certain it would be clear, and he told
Professor Jones to go ahead.</p>
<p>On the night of the fifth, just as the professor got
his Catherine wheels and skyrockets all in position, it began
to rain, and that was the most awful storm we have
had this year. It raised the river nearly three feet. As
soon as it began, Cooley got the ax, and went upstairs
and smashed his hydrometers, hygrometers, barometers,
and thermometers. Then he cut down the pole that upheld
the weathercock, and burned the manuscript of the
book which he was writing in explanation of his system.
He leans on &ldquo;Old Probs&rdquo; now when he wants to ascertain
the probable state of the weather.</p>

<h3>Scale Ounce Over Forty Years.</h3>
<p>Sealer of Weights and Measures Robert J. Hongen, of
Weissport, Pa., in testing a scale used by one of the leading
merchants for the past forty years, found that it
allowed seventeen instead of sixteen ounces to the
pound.</p>
<p>The merchant says he must have lost considerably
through this scale, but is glad that it operated in favor
of his customers.</p>
<h3>Family of Twenty Children.</h3>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Jacob Anstine, natives of the Pigeon
Mountains, near Spring Grove, Pa., are the parents of
twenty children&mdash;eight boys and twelve girls. There are
no twins or triplets among them.</p>
<p>Mr. Anstine is fifty years old and his wife is forty-five.
They live in the remotest part of the Pigeon Mountains,
in a small hut having but four rooms. The oldest child
is twenty-four years old. The whole family is hale and
hearty despite the limited accommodations of their little
house. They live mostly by money earned from wood-cutting
in the forests.</p>
<h3>Famous &ldquo;Houn&rsquo; Dawg&rdquo; in Bad.</h3>
<p>The &ldquo;houn&rsquo; dawg&rdquo; is doomed. The hills that now resound
with his throaty bellow are to be dotted with
sheep and subside in silence, believes Doctor A. J. Hill,
who has assisted in preparing a legislative &ldquo;tin can&rdquo; to
tie to the sagging tail of the kicked-around hound. The
dogs are blamed for the high price of mutton and the
low price of sheep in the State of Missouri.</p>
<p>Doctor Hill and other interested landowners have
drafted a law which provides that all dogs in the State
shall be taxed, and that the tax money shall constitute an
insurance fund to reimburse sheep owners for their
losses by dogs.</p>
<h3>Wisdom Teeth; Why so Called.</h3>
<p>The so-called wisdom teeth are the last two molars to
grow, and they have no real connection with the possession
of wisdom. They take their name from the time
of their arrival, from twenty to twenty-five years, at which
age the average person is supposed to have reached years
of discretion.</p>
<p>Cutting one&rsquo;s wisdom teeth means simply arriving at the
point of completeness in physical equipment, and has no
direct relation to mental equipment. The possession of
these teeth is no guarantee of wisdom. They grow at
about the same age in people whether they are wise
or not.</p>
<h3>Walnut Tree Forty-six Years Old.</h3>
<p>Colusa, Cal., is laying claim to having the largest California
black walnut in the world, but the dimensions of
the Colusa tree do not come up to those of a tree that is
growing on F. W. Schutz&rsquo;s farm on Sycamore Slough,
six miles northeast of Arbuckle, also in Colusa County.</p>
<p>Some time ago an account in newspapers first brought
this monster tree before the reading public, and it received
much attention throughout the State. The agricultural
department of the State University wrote Schutz
about it, stating that information sent by him would be
used in a book that the department is compiling.</p>
<p>In answer to the request of the university authorities
Mr. Schutz has taken accurate measurements of the tree,
which are as follows: Circumference one foot from the
ground, twenty-two feet, eight inches&mdash;below this the
roots appear above the surface of the ground, making the
tree about twenty-six feet; circumference nine feet from
the ground, nineteen feet nine inches; height, 102 feet;
width of shadow at noon, 120 feet.</p>
<p>The big tree is forty-six years old, having been planted
in 1868 by D. Arnold, a Colusa County pioneer.</p>
<h3>Virginia&rsquo;s Oldest Cow Dies.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Old Nancy,&rdquo; said to be the oldest cow in Virginia,
is dead. This cow was fifty-two years old when she expired
with the old year, thus turning the recent holiday
into a day of gloom for her owner and others. When
young, the cow&rsquo;s color had been a blood-red, but for more
than twenty years her hair had been turning white, until
at the time of her death her hair was as white as the
snow that covered the ground.</p>
<p>Her owner, John Adkins, of Big Laurel, Va., was only
one day older than Nancy, and at his marriage the cow&mdash;then
being over twenty&mdash;was a wedding gift from his
father, who said: &ldquo;Keep Nancy until she dies, John, for
she&rsquo;s a good old cow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In recent years her owner has been offered good round
sums for the aged animal, but he invariably refused,
with the remark: &ldquo;No, no; I&rsquo;d just as soon think of
parting with Martha&mdash;his wife&mdash;as to allow old Nancy
to be toted around the country with a show.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Emigrant from Erin Dies a Millionaire.</h3>
<p>The story of the hunt for gold is ever a story of toil
and privation, often a tragedy. For the one who strikes
it rich, thousands are lost in the oblivion of poverty and
ill fate.</p>
<p>Colonel Thomas Cruse, who died at the age of seventy-nine,
in Helena, Mont., recently, was one of the lucky
few who leaped from poverty to affluence thirty years ago.
He discovered the Drum Lummon Gold Mine, north
of Helena, sold it to an English syndicate for $1,500,000,
retaining one-sixth interest, and shared in the profits of
$30,000,000 which the mine has produced.</p>
<p>Mr. Cruse was twenty years old when he left County
Cavan, Ireland, to seek his fortune in the mining camps
of the West. He roamed around various diggings in
California, Nevada, and Idaho, blew into Virginia City,
Mont., in 1865, when Alder Gulch was at the height of
its glory, and later struck the placers around Helena,
where fortune smiled upon him.</p>
<p>Drum Lummon drew its name from the locality in Ireland
where Cruse was born. Before it had a name it
had a romance redolent with the ill luck of the original
finder. He was a little, wiry Frenchman named L. F.
Hilderbrand, who drove an express wagon to Deadwood
long after Tommy Cruse put Drum Lummon on the
mining map. In the very early days Hilderbrand prospected
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
in Montana. A stumble on the mountain side
caused him to chip off a piece of a bowlder which was
so rich in gold quartz that his eyes popped in the excitement
of riches in sight. He and his partner began
to look for the lead from which the bowlder sloughed off.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Hilderbrand and his partner undertook
to roll out of the way the great bowlder which gave
them a clew to wealth. By one of those queer capers of
blasted luck which prospectors fear, the bowlder moved
too quickly and rolled over and crushed the arm of Hilderbrand&rsquo;s
partner. Being without money and needing medical
attention, they left the place, trudged to Helena, where
the partner was under the care of a doctor, and Hilderbrand
went to work in near-by places to earn money to
pay the bill.</p>
<p>Some ten years later, Hilderbrand, still at outs with
his luck, and weary of roaming, reached the spot where
the bowlder sent his hopes skyward. The bowlder had
the appearance of an old acquaintance, but the surroundings
were changed to a bewildering extent. Before his
eyes was a monster hoisting plant raising rich ore from
a shaft hundreds of feet in depth, while in the gulch a
huge stamp mill was at work. The bowlder occupied a
place of honor in front of a building. Hilderbrand
touched it, patted it affectionately, and tears filled his eyes.
Presently through the mist of his tears he read the sign:
&ldquo;Drum Lummon Mine, discovered by Thomas Cruse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the period of development, when hard luck
pressed Cruse to the verge of abandonment, some one advised
him to strike Sam Ashby for a couple of hundred.
Ashby was a money lender in Helena who knew how to
sweat the coin when put at work on good security. Cruse
put the matter of a loan up to Ashby. All he got, however,
was a fine line of free advice, coupled with the
money lender&rsquo;s assurance that he would rather throw
paper money into the furnaces of his satanic majesty than
loan it to such a &ldquo;shiftless fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Years after, when Cruse&rsquo;s day of prosperity came, one
of the early visitors to the &ldquo;Thomas Cruse Savings Bank,&rdquo;
just started in Helena, was Sam Ashby. The fortunes
of Cruse and Ashby had been reversed. Cruse was flush,
Ashby empty of pocket. Cruse led his would-be customer
to the door, and, in the underscored language of the West,
assured the customer that he would rather throw his
money into the furnaces of his satanic majesty than to loan
it to such &ldquo;a shiftless fellow&rdquo; as Sam Ashby.</p>
<p>Soon after his bank was started, at the age of fifty,
Cruse decided that he had enough capital to support a
wife. Miss Margaret Carter, sister of the later United
States Senator Carter, became Mrs. Cruse. The wedding,
in 1886, was the greatest social event in the history of
Montana&rsquo;s capital. It was a celebration for all the population.</p>
<p>Cruse arranged for an open house and free drinks with
every saloon in Helena. Tradition has it that the whole
male population of the town got drunk at the bridegroom&rsquo;s
expense, and it took a week to sober the people
into a working condition. The jamboree was the greatest
ever pulled off in the treasure State; no one attempted
to rival the score.</p>
<p>The joys of wedded life were of short duration, however.
Mrs. Cruse died within a year, leaving a baby daughter,
on which the father lavished his affections and
means.</p>
<p>What Count John A. Creighton was to Omaha, Thomas
Cruse was to Helena. Every public enterprise, every
promising industry, drew his support; benevolent and
charitable movements commanded assistance from his
purse. He was the chief contributor to the building of
the Catholic Cathedral of Helena, which was dedicated on
Christmas Day, the Methodist Hospital, the Young Men&rsquo;s
Christian Association, and the Young Women&rsquo;s Christian
Association shared in his bounty, and his liberality in supporting
the local club kept Helena on the baseball map.</p>
<p>The career of Mr. Cruse was linked in many ways with
the active lives of several former Omaha residents. A
year or two before Cruse struck Alder Gulch, Patrick
Gurnett, Mrs. Gurnett, and three young children started
from Omaha with a bull team in a caravan which occupied
six months in covering the distance to Virginia City,
Mont. Cruse and the Gurnetts probably became acquainted
there.</p>
<p>In subsequent years, when the Gurnetts became ranchers
in the Missoula valley, south of Helena, Cruse&rsquo;s poverty as
a prospector was frequently relieved by the food reserves
of the Gurnett homestead.</p>
<p>Frank J. Lange, son of an Omaha family of pioneer
grocers, is the active manager of Cruse&rsquo;s Savings Bank,
and has been confidential associate and adviser of the
millionaire for years past.</p>
<p>Another man, Harry Cotter, married Cruse&rsquo;s daughter,
Mary, who died a year ago last November. Cruse and
Cotter did not pull together, and the death of the daughter
widened the breach, which continued to the gold miner&rsquo;s
end.</p>
<h3>Put Nickle in Slot, Get Paper Raincoat.</h3>
<p>Have you ever arrived in your old home town in a pelting
rainstorm, all dolled up in your Sunday best, and
been compelled to pass up a quarter to the local bus man
or linger around the depot until some good Samaritan
with an umbrella is kind enough to escort you to the
abode of your family or friends?</p>
<p>Have you ever noticed a flock of pretty but scolding
maidens in a downtown doorway or the post-office entrance,
or the vestibule of a movie-picture place wildly
calling for umbrellas, raincoats, newspapers, brother&rsquo;s,
or best beau&rsquo;s silk handkerchief, or anything to prevent
that lovely seven or ten-dollar hat from being ruined by
the sudden shower?</p>
<p>If you are a masculine reader, have you ever been compelled
to &ldquo;cough up&rdquo; from three to six dollars in order
to get your fair Dulcinea home from play or dance when
it is raining pitchforks and black cats and the rubber-coated
man on the box has suddenly become so stiff and
lofty&mdash;in his price, at least&mdash;that occasionally one doubts
if he can be touched even with a ten-spot bill or a ten-foot
pole?</p>
<p>If you have ever passed through any of the above-enumerated
experiences&mdash;and what man or woman has not&mdash;forget
it; deliverance is at hand. The hour of the hastily
impressed newspaper, the borrowed umbrella, or the painfully
extracted cash loan from the hotel clerk or elevator
boy is to bob up unserenely no more, for the paper raincoat
has taken its place alongside the egg sandwich, chewing
gum, and insurance policies placed before the public
in vending machines.</p>
<p>The man or woman who drops a nickel for a package
of gum to aid in the digestion of his nickel-in-the-slot
meal, and then pays a quarter to another machine for
a policy insuring him or her against the consequences, may
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
soon get a raincoat from an adjacent machine as a result
of the ingenuity of a woman, who has obtained a patent
on a paper raincoat, said to be waterproof. She plans
to manufacture the coats in large quantities and distribute
them in specially devised vending devices.</p>
<p>It is to be presumed that the feminine raincoat will be
provided with a cute little hood, or capote, as they say
in French, and possibly the masculine garment will have
some attachment that will be quite eskimo and save
the wearer&rsquo;s two-dollar derby from gaining an inch or two
in circumference. All hail, hoch, also hear-hear to the
paper raincoat! Bah to the never-present, disappearing,
eye-destroying, pestiferous umbrella.</p>
<h3>&ldquo;Corpse&rdquo; Smokes in Hearse.</h3>
<p>Panic was caused along the road between Jefferson and
Chapel, Ohio, by the spectacle of what apparently was a
corpse sitting upright in the middle of a hearse and serenely
puffing a cigar.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;remains&rdquo; which had indulged in this unseemly
performance were Will Hodge, of Jefferson. Hodge had
attended the funeral of an aunt at Chapel. On the long
trip home after the interment, Hodge started riding beside
the driver of the hearse.</p>
<p>The intense cold soon chilled him to the bone, and he
obtained permission from the driver to get inside the
glass case. Here he soon got warm, and, to add to the
comfort of his journey, he lighted a cigar. Rural folks
along the way were terrified.</p>
<h3>Toss on Raft Four Days at Sea.</h3>
<p>Twelve of them, ten men and two women, were out
there on the Atlantic for four days, tossing on a sea-made
raft, and no one in New York knew of it until
Charles Olsen, the mate, a six-foot, fair-haired Swede,
came in on the ward liner <i>Monterey</i> and told the story.</p>
<p>It was some story, too, this simple chronological narrative
of the breaking up of the American barkentine
<i>Ethel V. Boynton</i> some sixty miles east of Wilmington,
N. C. Olsen said it was God alone who saved him and
his mates. None of them ever expected to see land
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tell all we went through,&rdquo; he said, half smiling,
&ldquo;because, in the first place, it would take too long,
and then, when I get through, you&rsquo;d think I was thinking
things, especially when I told you how the sharks swam
round waiting for us and we beat them off, hitting them
on their heads with our paddles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;d better begin at the beginning like I was
reading from the log. So I don&rsquo;t forget it, take it down
right here now that the twelve of us lived for six days
on a two-pound can of tripe and three cans of blueberries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The barkentine left Mobile December 26th, with lumber
for Genoa, Italy, in command of Captain G. W. Waldemar
and a crew of nine men. On board was Mrs. Waldemar
and her young niece, Miss Gladys Larrock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just at sunrise,&rdquo; said Olsen, &ldquo;we ran into a hurricane
that came up from the south. It got so bad that we
hove to at eight a. m. until midnight. It eased up a little,
but came up again strong by seven o&rsquo;clock next morning.
We fired the deck load overboard&mdash;had to do it,
and do it quick; she was leaking pretty badly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About ten-fifteen a. m. up came one of those racers&mdash;you
know what I mean, three waves chasing one right
behind another. It came full at us and swept clean
over. It seemed to curl up about forty feet above the
deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wave tore out about thirty feet of our quarterdeck
and carried it over. At midnight we were completely
water-logged. Next morning, at two-thirty, we
shipped another of those racers, and it carried off the
forrid house and the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;s&rsquo;le deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got kind of uneasy about the two women. They
never said a word. If they were scared, they didn&rsquo;t let
anybody know it, and we didn&rsquo;t let them know we were
worried about &rsquo;em. At six a. m. we cut away the main
and mizzen sticks, and thought for a while we were
going to stay above water, but at nine a. m. we knew it
was all off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About nine-fifteen a. m. we launched the yawl. But
what was the use? We just did it on a chance, anyway.
That yawl had hardly hit the water when she was
smashed to pieces against the side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big sticks of lumber from our jettisoned cargo now
slammed the barkentine hard. At ten a. m. the starboard
side opened up. That was some day. At eight-thirty
p. m. the foremast jammed itself through the bottom;
a big part of the foredeck drifted away with it. We
were just simply going to pieces. We didn&rsquo;t know where
to lash the women, because we couldn&rsquo;t say what part
would go away next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lumber in the hold was just raising hell. The
morning of the next day, at three-thirty o&rsquo;clock, the stern
broke off entirely. At five-thirty a. m. the main deck
splintered and so did the after house. A half hour
later we made a raft out of the roof of it. We all got
onto it, lashing the women. They lay flat and had a
hard job to keep from choking, because the waves were
hitting us hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At seven-thirty a. m. we sighted the main deck, and
started out for it. It took us two hours to paddle. We
used pieces of the lumber that drifted to us. When we
all climbed on board, we made fast the raft to it. That
was the last thing we did, because at eleven p. m., after
three days and nights on the drifting main deck, the thing
bu&rsquo;sted to pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the only time the women showed excitement.
They didn&rsquo;t want to get back on that raft. The
little gal, Miss Larrock, she lives in Boston, like I do. She
said to me: &lsquo;Mate, we will never see Boston again.&rsquo; I
said: &lsquo;Oh, yes. Don&rsquo;t you give up, little gal, not much.&rsquo;
She laughed&mdash;it sounded like she was laughing&mdash;and she
said something she read some time out of a book. &lsquo;Well,
mate, we will die with good and true hearts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we didn&rsquo;t die. The Ward steamer <i>Manzanillo</i>
came along at ten-thirty o&rsquo;clock the morning after the
main deck bu&rsquo;sted to pieces, and we can thank Warner,
the cook, that she saw us. He grabbed the code flag R
when we left the vessel, and we stuck it up on a piece
of lumber on the raft. It is a red flag, with a yellow
cross, and they could see it better than most any
flag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Olsen turned to the cook and slapped him hard between
the shoulders. &ldquo;Freddy, old boy, we never missed a meal,
did we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Warner winced and acquiesced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; continued the mate, &ldquo;the twelve of us lived
for six days on that measly two-pound can of tripe
and three tins of blueberries. Freddie, here, opened
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
the can of tripe with his teeth and an old fork. Then
he speared a piece at a time on a wire and handed
it around three times a day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, by gosh, the skipper looked at every piece that
was swallowed. He said: &lsquo;I caution you fellas to go
light on that tripe, because we might be a long time here.
One of the three cans of berries was given to four of
us. We had a three-gallon keg of dirty fresh water
with us on the raft, and it tasted fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Manzanillo</i> landed the Boynton&rsquo;s crew at Santiago,
Cuba, where they were cared for in a hospital. The
skipper and his wife and niece later went by steamer
to Mobile.</p>
<h3>How &ldquo;Long&rdquo; is a Kiss? &ldquo;Long&rdquo; Meant, Not &ldquo;Why.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>How long is a kiss? No, not &ldquo;why?&rdquo;&mdash;nobody so
foolish as to ask that&mdash;but &ldquo;how long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as you can hold your breath,&rdquo; somebody has
said, but the question which moving-picture censors and
actors and actresses are debating now is, how much film
a kiss may, with propriety, fill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three feet is the limit,&rdquo; said a recent ruling of
the Chicago board of censors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too much,&rdquo; said Miss Ruth Stonehouse, one of
the favorites of the &ldquo;movie fans.&rdquo; &ldquo;No kiss has a right
to more than one foot of film.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, when an actress is kissed on the stage, it
isn&rsquo;t because she wants to be kissed, but because the
artistry of the play demands it, to indicate emotion on
the part of the stage characters. It is utterly impersonal,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is?&rdquo; ventured the interviewer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course. It isn&rsquo;t really the actress who is being
kissed, but the character she represents. Sometimes an
unskilled actress uses the prolonged kiss to convey her
idea of a love scene, but if she understands the art of
expression, it is unnecessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But would you limit the real, honest-to-goodness
love kiss to one foot?&rdquo; asked the &ldquo;cub&rdquo; reporter anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were talking of the stage,&rdquo; she replied gracefully.
&ldquo;The kind you mean, my dear boy, are a quite different
affair.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Oklahomans Plan Second Wolf Drive.</h3>
<p>A wolf drive on a large scale occurred in the hills west
of Greenfield, Okla., a few weeks ago. The ground covered
was about twenty-five square miles. The lines were
formed at ten a. m. and at the signal shot thousands of
hunters began to move in toward the center.</p>
<p>When within a mile of the center, all lines were halted
and orders were given by the captains to cease firing
until the encircling line could be formed solid, but before
this could be accomplished, many wolves escaped. When
the hunters closed in, eight wolves were discovered, but
five of the eight managed to get away. Many rabbits were
killed, however.</p>
<p>There will be another hunt over the same ground
and considerable added territory. The circular sent out
to all residents of the vicinity says the recent drive was
not satisfactory, as several wolves were allowed to make
their escape. It is now proposed to have a big wolf drive
and barbecue dinner after the round-up to all that go into
the lines and help make the drive a success. It has been
decided that the captains issue tickets to all men in their
respective lines, all able-bodied to take part in some line.
The committee asks the hearty co&ouml;peration of every man
within the adjoining territory to make this drive a success,
as it is not a matter of sport only, but an effort
to rid the country of wolves.</p>
<p>The drive will cover forty-nine square miles, making
each line seven miles in length. &ldquo;We want to make
this drive the most successful of any held in Oklahoma,
and ask that you leave all booze at home to prevent
accidents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All firearms are barred except shotguns, and no shot
to be used larger than No. 4.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The circular further says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each captain will be entitled to four sergeants to
help him with his mile. There will be no shot fired from
nine a. m. to ten a. m., the time of starting. The signal
to start will be given at the southeast corner promptly
at ten a. m., each captain to fire his gun, and the sergeants
to fire their guns in turn until the signal is carried entirely
around the lines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All wolves are to be sold at auction, and the proceeds
to go to pay for coffee and bread. The meat is
to be donated and barbecued on the ground for all who
hold tickets. So be sure that you are in one of the
lines in order to get a ticket. Ladies are invited to
the round-up ground and will get their dinner free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No quail to be shot, and all rabbits to be saved
and sent to Oklahoma City, to be distributed among the
poor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also please remember, no shooting in the center at
round-up ground. The drive will be held immediately
west of Greenfield.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Is Champion Hose Knitter.</h3>
<p>Without doubt &ldquo;Aunt Sallie&rdquo; Hardly, of Big Laurel, Va.,
is the champion hose knitter in the world. She has just
celebrated her eighty-fifth birthday by knitting a pair of
men&rsquo;s hose. Her hobby has always been knitting. She
could knit a pair of men&rsquo;s hose in two days when she
was nine years old. Aunt Sallie thirty years ago began
keeping a record of hose knit, and since that time has
completed 10,005 pairs, she says. &ldquo;I believe that in all
I have knitted over fifteen thousand pairs, and have hopes
of making it twenty thousand before I reach one hundred,
which age I believe I will live to see,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<h3>Girl Rifle Team Gets &ldquo;Defi.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s rifle team of the Iowa City High School,
Iowa City, Ia., has been challenged by a girls&rsquo; rifle team
of Washington, D. C., and probably will accept the &ldquo;defi.&rdquo;
The coach is Professor C. E. Williams, a member of the
Iowa university national championship team of other days,
and now coach of the national high-school champion five
of Iowa City.</p>
<h3>Small Pitching Staff Best, Says Old-timer.</h3>
<p>Jimmy Ryan, veteran player and one of the best of
the famous Chicago Colts, believes baseball is going
back to the old days, when five pitchers were all the
biggest club would carry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At present,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;we find big-league clubs with
ten or more pitchers on the pay roll, when three or
four are actually doing the work. What is the result?
Why, these regulars are liable to be fretty because they
have to perform the heavy tasks and at the same
time see six or seven men sitting on the bench drawing
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
pay and performing no actual labor in championship
games.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why do I have to do so much and wear myself
out, when those guys are having it so soft?&rsquo; they frequently
say to themselves. And you can&rsquo;t blame them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instead of a dozen high-priced men stepping on each
others&rsquo; toes, I believe that the day is coming when six
will be the limit any club carries. Manager Stallings, of
the Boston Braves, has shown to the present generation
that it can be done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back in the eighties, when I was pitching, John Clarkson,
another fellow, and myself would do the bulk of
the work. And it didn&rsquo;t hurt us any, either. We were in
shape, and had to keep so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was seldom one heard a pitcher say he was feeling
bad then, or had a kink in the arm. He had to get out
and work or lose his job.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can talk all they want to about baseball&rsquo;s improving.
But I fail to see it that way. We could teach the
present-day players a lot about the game, and I&rsquo;m not
the only one who thinks so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard work never hurt any ball player. You see what
it did for the Boston Braves! It won them a world&rsquo;s
championship.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Catches Coyotes in an Original Manner.</h3>
<p>A coyote likes to have a newspaper clipping to read
before it puts its foot in a trap. This is according to
the philosophy of John Harvey, of Riverside County,
California, who has about two hundred animals to his
credit&mdash;by traps, shotgun, and poison.</p>
<p>Harvey&rsquo;s favorite trap is one of the familiar steel-jawed
type with a strong spring at each end. He sets it with
his knees, by bringing almost his whole weight on the
springs. The spot chosen is usually on plowed or cultivated
ground. The flat pan, or trigger, of the trap is
covered skillfully with a piece of newspaper about four
inches square, and all is carefully covered with earth.
Even the six-foot chain and drag are concealed. Then
over the place spread a lot of chicken or bird feathers,
and any other available animal or fowl trash, such as
entrails and pieces of pelt. This proves the undoing of
Mr. Coyote when he comes prowling about in the night.</p>
<p>The trapping is generally done in the fall or winter,
after the buzzards have migrated, as the bait is also
tempting to that kind of &ldquo;health&rdquo; birds.</p>
<h3>Bars Men Who Drink Liquor.</h3>
<p>The Milton Manufacturing Company, an ironworking
concern which has the largest plant in Milton, Pa., with
hundreds of employees, has posted notices in the plant,
barring all men who use intoxicating drinks. Employees
who have signed saloon applications for the establishing
of saloons, now before the Northumberland County
court, must have their names withdrawn from the applications
if they desire to continue in the company&rsquo;s service.</p>
<h3>Lost Diamond Mine Discoverer is Found.</h3>
<p>The lost locator of Kimberley lost diamond mines has
been found. Joseph H. Meyers, for whom a world-wide
search was started three months ago by men whom he
had interested in a South African diamond-mining proposition,
has written to the stockholders of his company
explaining his long silence and giving a report on the
prospects of the undertaking.</p>
<p>Meyers had been missing since July 5, 1910, and Doctor
Fred C. Wheat, of Minneapolis, Minn., last November
asked members of the Iowa Alumni Association to &ldquo;comb
all the quarters of the earth&rdquo; in an effort to find him.
Meyers was a graduate at the class of 1888, University of
Iowa.</p>
<p>Meyers is a mining engineer, and his wife is said to
be an expert in minerals. In 1904 he was in charge of
a large mine at San Jos&eacute;, Cal., where he befriended an
old Scotchman named Sandy McDonald. When the old
man died, he showed Meyers a map giving the location
of a valuable diamond mine near Kimberley. This map,
he said, he had secured from another Scotchman.</p>
<p>Meyers, at first skeptical, finally went to Kimberley,
found the mine, and returned with the report that in a
few days he had dug out five hundred carat weight of
gems. He interested his friends in the United States
and secured $25,000 to buy the land. If he had taken
it as a diamond claim, he would have had to split the
diamonds with the government.</p>
<p>Returning to South Africa, he found that the price of
the land had gone up as a result of the discovery of
other mines near, and he was forced to return to this
country and raise $10,000 more. He was last seen in
San Francisco.</p>
<p>In a letter to J. L. McLaury, of Glenwood, Minn.,
Meyers, writing from Fresno, says he is still blocked
in his effort to secure title to the diamond property, but
that the obstacle may be removed any day.</p>
<p>Doctor Wheat refuses to discuss the details of the venture,
although he said that he was satisfied that Meyers
was absolutely honest, and that eventually the proposition
would be a success.</p>
<h3>King of the Rabbit Hunters.</h3>
<p>Stephen Osborn, seventy-eight years old, who lives five
miles southwest of Gentry, Mo., claims the distinction of
being the champion rabbit hunter&mdash;for his age, at least&mdash;of
northwestern Missouri. He has killed 500 rabbits so
far this winter, and is not through yet.</p>
<p>Osborn, who is an expert shot, does his hunting in a
buggy which is drawn by a twenty-one-year-old horse.
He is accompanied by two dogs. The dogs scare the
rabbits from their hiding places; then, after the fatal
shot is fired, they bring the dead animals to the hunter,
who is not compelled to leave his buggy. Osborn says
his best day&rsquo;s work was forty-nine rabbits out of fifty
shots.</p>
<h3>Modern Lumberjack a Real Aristocrat.</h3>
<p>Should an old-time lumberjack wander back into the
neighborhood of Mellen, Wis., searching for old, familiar
scenes, and with the possible desire to once again,
for a brief time, enter into the old calling for pastime
or physical improvement, he would be apt to make a
hasty survey of present conditions, and, with a voice
softened by disappointment, declare: &ldquo;No, this is not the
same&mdash;not at all the same. This may be all right for
a minister&rsquo;s son, but not for me&mdash;not for me. Too much
like Chicago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Last week residents of Mellen had an opportunity to
watch a train of new boarding cars switched out into the
woods over the logging railroad of the Foster-Latimer
Lumber Company. The cars were built in the local car
shops of that concern and are the last word in quarters
for woodsmen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>The outfit comprises a &ldquo;kitchen car,&rdquo; equipped with the
most modern kitchen appliances, such as can only be
found in the culinary departments in hotels of large
cities; two &ldquo;sleepers,&rdquo; equipped with steel double-deck
beds, springs, and mattresses, there being no bunks, but
regular upper and lower berths, each for two persons
and provided with individual ventilating windows; in
the roof are also eight patent ventilator stacks. The
two diners are provided with individual tables for setting
four persons each.</p>
<p>The entire train is comfortably heated by steam heat.
The cars are provided with hard-wood floors, neatly painted
inside and out, well lighted, and also provided with the
latest model gasoline-lighting system.</p>
<h3>Set New Roller-skate Mark.</h3>
<p>Frank Bryant, of Duluth, and Raymond Kelly, of St.
Paul, lowered the world&rsquo;s record for relay roller skating
when they finished their twenty-four-hour grind in Duluth,
Minn. The team skated 348 miles and eight laps.</p>
<p>Fred Martin, of Milwaukee, and Frank Bacon, of Detroit,
made the former record two weeks ago at the
Madison Square Garden, when they rolled off 293 miles.</p>
<p>Bryant and Kelly showed wonderful endurance, by
sprinting the last two hours. They are professionals,
Bryant being Northwestern champion on the wheels.</p>
<h3>Two Days Under Felled Tree.</h3>
<p>A Mexican living three miles southwest of Binger, Okla.,
was chopping wood, when a tree fell on him and held
him fast from Friday until Sunday morning. An Indian
chief, &ldquo;Big Snow,&rdquo; discovered the Mexican&rsquo;s plight and
succeeded in releasing him. There were no bones broken,
but the Mexican was badly bruised and suffered much
from his long exposure to the cold.</p>
<h3>Hero Gives His Life to Save Little Child.</h3>
<p>This is a story of a brave and heroic youth who
sacrificed his own life that a little child might live.
The tragedy marked the close of a merry coasting party,
and the death toll might have been greater but for the
unfortunate hero, Edward Schumacher, aged seventeen
years.</p>
<p>Near Dundee, Ill., a fine hill stretches, invitingly long
and white in the winter days and nights. For long it
has been a favorite spot for coasters, and it was not
unusual that the fatal evening found a gay party spinning
down the shimmering course. Schumacher sat at the
steering lever of the big coasting &ldquo;bob,&rdquo; with a small
child in his lap. Behind were three other boys and four
girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, little fellow,&rdquo; he said to the timid
child. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take good care of you, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sled shot down the incline at a furious speed. Half-way
to the bottom it encountered a sharp grade and became
unmanageable. The steersman lost control for a
moment, and the &ldquo;bob&rdquo; darted to the side just as a post
loomed up a few paces ahead. Collision was inevitable.</p>
<p>Schumacher&rsquo;s mind worked quickly, and then, without
a thought of consequences to himself, he flung the child
from him into a deep snowbank. The next instant the
sled hurled itself upon the post, with the steersman still
at his place.</p>
<p>The child was picked up, unhurt, and of the seven
young persons who sat behind, none were injured beyond
a severe shaking up, but the boy in whose hands, for a
moment, were the lives of all in the sled lived only
a few minutes after the crash. But he had kept his
promise to the child, even at the cost of his own life.</p>
<h3>Is Seventy-five and &ldquo;Spry as a Cricket.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>There is an old lady living in Harrogate, Tenn., Taylor
by name, who, at the age of seventy-five years, is the
mother of fifteen children, 108 grandchildren, ninety-six
great-grandchildren, and 25 great-great-grandchildren, and
she is still as spry as a cricket.</p>
<h3>New Line Over Continent.</h3>
<p>Work on the latest American transcontinental railroad
is nearing completion. &ldquo;Only a few miles remain to link
the Canadian Northern railroad from ocean to ocean,&rdquo;
said R. Creelman, general passenger agent of the Canadian
Northern, when on a visit in Chicago the other
day. &ldquo;The last gap, north of Kamloops, in British Columbia,
is being closed at the rate of nearly three miles a
day, and the final linking of the unbroken line of steel
from the Atlantic to the Pacific should take place before
the end of this month. It still lacks more than four
years of a half century since the Union Pacific and the
Central Pacific linked the two oceans, forming the first
continuous all-rail route across the continent. In 1885
the Canadian Pacific was completed. The Canadian Northern
is the latest of the transcontinentals. The line extends
from Quebec through Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto,
Port Arthur, Winnipeg, Regina, Edmonton, Calgary, to
Vancouver. While the main line is approximately 3,100
miles long, from Quebec to Vancouver, feeders increase
the mileage of the system to slightly over 9,000, nearly
two-thirds of which has been in operation for a number
of years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The completed road will be a monument to the enterprise
of two famous railroad builders&mdash;Sir William Mackenzie
and Sir Donald Mann. Their first experience in
railroad building came with the construction of the Canadian
Pacific thirty years ago. Since 1896 they have been
engaged on the Canadian Northern system.&rdquo;</p>

are among the many benefits reported. Get rid of that
nervous feeling; no more need of pipe, cigar, cigarette,
snuff or chewing tobacco to pacify morbid desire.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
